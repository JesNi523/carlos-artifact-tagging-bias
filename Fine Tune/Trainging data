Ancient Iran produced a distinctive tradition of fine ceramics that remained a major art form for millennia.  The most significant regions with ceramic art were focused in northern Iran - along the Elburz mountains and south of the Caspian Sea; in the west along the Zagros mountains; and in the south and central lowlands, north of the Persian Gulf.  Over the millennia, the influx of new peoples brought the introduction of a variety of ceramic traditions; while in many isolated mountainous regions, ceramic motifs and techniques survived for centuries.  The ceramic vessels of ancient Iran were characterized by elegant rounded forms, often with narrow mouths or beak-like spouts.  Two types of surface decoration usually were employed.  Much of the fine ware features painted dark-on-white or buff-colored decoration with geometric designs or cursory depictions of goats, birds and bulls.  Another surface technique, appearing on fine ware as well as on utilitarian or kitchenware, was achieved through the manipulation of firing conditions in the kiln to produce a red-orange or gray-black surface color.  Both types of decoration were often enhanced by polishing or burnishing the pottery surface before firing to achieve a shiny, almost metallic sheen.\n1, 2. Known as Kaftari ware, after the site where many examples were discovered, these vessels featured decoration with dark painted plump water birds and dense bands of geometric motifs.  The spread of this distinctive decoration throughout southwest and southern Iran indicated the extent of Elamite influence in the regions during the second millennium BC.\n3. Like southwestern Iran, the mountainous regions of western Iran also produced a tradition of dark-on-buff painted decoration.  Storage jars with decoration restricted to the shoulders of the vessel were commonly left in tombs.  The vessel shape, location of the decoration, and the waterbird motif reflects Elamite influence.\n5, 8, 10.  The area of northern Iran, south of the Caspian Sea, produced a substantial ceramic industry dating from the end of the second millennium to the early first millennium BC.  Tombs in the region, especially in the Gilan province, were richly furnished with attractive vessels of burnished red or gray ware.  Many of the vessels, serving a ritual function, were made in the form of humped bulls, deer, and gazelles.  More common ware, displayed here, was less elaborate and often decorated with simple incised or dotted motifs around the base of the necks (5)\n11. During the first millennium BC, the region of central Iran, especially around Tepe Sialk, produced a tradition of beautifully painted ceramics comprising beaked jugs and cups with dark on white decoration.  Bands of geometric motifs, including rays, lozenges, checkerboards, and rarer designs of animals were employed.\n12. These figurines, found throughout the Persian Empire from Iran to the Levant, are often called ¿Persian riders¿ since their headgear, consisting of a hat covering the chin and cheeks, was the national headdress of the Persians.\n1.

This matched pair, a man and a woman, represent a couple who were married --or the social equivalent-- in ancient West Mexico.  Other large ceramic sculptures from this region physically join individuals and smaller images often depict touching, even lovemaking.  In short, intimacy and bondedness are principal themes, implying not only the character of society but also the role of images in the grave.     West Mexican burials were placed in chambers joined to the earth's surface by vertical shafts up to fifty feet in length.  The rooms of these shaft tombs were filled with many clay sculptures set at the heads of the deceased.  It appears that images of connection were deemed important to accompany the dead during the transition to the afterlife; perhaps to provide them with stand-ins for their loved ones left behind.  The extreme separation of the chambers from the surface and the fact that the long shafts were completely filled with rubble strongly suggests that the living sought to place distance between themselves and the deceased.  Thus, the sculptures safely and symbolically contradicted that isolation by stressing the continued bonds between people in the two realms.  \"\"\n\nBlack lighting results:\nRight leg was broken; right knee a lighter color; everything else looks ok.\n\nPermanent collection gallery:\nEarly Mesoamerican Art \n\nLarge, well-made ceramic sculptures and vessels filled the tombs of ancient western Mexico and accompanied the dead on their afterlife journey. Male-female pairs (12, 13) and dogs (16) are the most common sculptural subjects. The images of matching couples reveal an interest in showing human connections, a logical concern when the living and the dead are separated. Dogs, loyal companions since they came over from Asia across the Bering Strait with the first Americans, are also reunited with their masters via clay effigies in burials. Well-made bowls with geometric patterns (14) or human faces (15) likely held food intended to feed the soul of the deceased.\n\nTiny architectural models in stone (8, 9), also placed in burials, seem to represent temples or monuments to the ancestors, which may explain the recumbent figure on the roof of 9. \n\nAn important trade item in early ancient Mesoamerica was obsidian, or volcanic glass (1-7). It was prized primarily for its razor-sharp edge (it is still employed today in some eye surgery). From weapons such as spear points (1, 2) to cutting tools such as knives (7), obsidian was the material of choice. With great skill, blades (4) could be chiseled off of cores (3, 5, 6), but the process of striking off a blade as thin and translucent as this one, prone to breaking, was difficult to master. The Aztecs mounted such blades along the length of a club for a highly effective weapon. Some obsidian is naturally greenish (1) and was particularly prestigious and rare. \n\nIn Mesoamerican languages the word \"\"green\"\" also means \"\"precious.\"\" Utilitarian hand axes were  commemorated in greenstone ceremonial versions (10, 11). Too small to be useful for agricultural work, these fancy axes, known as celts, were found in many parts of Mesoamerica in early times. The form was highly influential southward in Costa Rica, where celts became highly elaborate and worn as necklaces.\n\n1.  Bifacial Pachua Obsidian Point.  Mesoamerica, West Mexico, Colima.

Witten II\n\n2013 Reinstallation label:\nEarly Mesoamerican Art\nAcross the world, early artistic statements often include female figurines (1–4) probably because pre-industrial societies rely heavily on women’s fertility for survival. This encourages the creation of images of plump females—individuals with enough body fat to menstruate, conceive, and carry a child. Having enough extra food was rare in ancient Mesoamerica, so body fat represented high status there as well. A protruding stomach and large navel (1), characterizing a woman who has given birth, were also prestigious. This figurine is also noteworthy because her arms move—thread looped through holes in the top of the arms and tied behind her neck hold them in various positions. This articulated figurine is four thousand years old, the oldest work in the American collection, proving that ancient does not mean artistically rudimentary.\nIn western Mexico ca. 200 BC to 300 AD clay effigies were sculpted, such as the seated couple (12, 13) and the dog (11). Originally they were placed with the deceased in deep shaft tombs, composed of chambers branching off a vertical opening deep below the surface. Couples are common subjects, perhaps images of family to stay with the dead members in the afterlife. In any case, the idea of connection between dead and alive is expressed; the cyclical Amerindian worldview does not entirely distinguish between death and life. Dogs were not only earthly companions, but were fattened and consumed in this area, so clay canines symbolize afterlife sustenance as well. As elsewhere, dogs also were believed to guide souls into the Other Side.\nMoving eastward, early Guerrero art featured the Mezcala [mehz cah lah] stone carving style (7, 8). Small, finely ground images of structures, complete with staircases and doors, sometimes include prone figures on top (8). This suggests the elevation of the deceased in/on a temple, implying these were models put in the grave to honor the ancestor. Since life and death were interrelated, the deceased influenced affairs of the living, ensuring the rains, fertility, and so on.\nIn early Central Mexico highly skilled ceramicists hand built large and impressive vessels (5, 6, 9, 10) at the site of Chupícuaro [choo peek wahr oh]. Simple tripods refer to the evolution from baskets to clay containers by painting a diagonal pattern around the rim (5), depicting the spiral finishing of baskets’ tops. More elaborate geometric patterns also follow diagonal formats that defer to the constraints of basket weaving (6, 9, 10). Though no actual textiles survive from this region, we can infer the importance of the fiber arts throughout Mesoamerican antiquity.\n1.

These artworks would have been worn by elites dressed in fine textiles and feathers, and placed in their tombs to accompany them on their afterlife journey.\n\nSpondylus shell (1), with its striking orange-red  color, was favored throughout ancient Mesoamerica and laboriously gathered from the Caribbean. This type of open-centered earspool is typical of the Maya (4, 7) and represents a flower. The earspool would have been held in place by a central bead strung on a string that went through the hole in the earlobe, with more beads behind the earlobe serving as a counterweight.\n\nMaya ceramics are most commonly polychrome, but earlier ones may be blackwares (9) and, later, unslipped buffwares (8, 10, 11). Like the painted pieces, a calligraphic line governs the fine incisions on 9, and delicate features are sculpted on the figurines. The latter are actually musical instruments: the mother and child (8) is a whistle, and the two standing females are rattles (10, 11).\n\nGreen stones were of the highest value to the Maya, and elite men were almost literally dripping with them: belt celts dangled from their waists (2), earspools from their ears (4, 7), and pendants from their necks (5). Even their teeth were inlaid with dots of green (3). Blue, a rare color in jadeite, was especially desired, but the sparkling qualities of other minerals were favored as well. The pendant is a particularly fine piece, combining a harpy eagle with a human skull. This piece was actually found in Costa Rica, reflecting the practice of trading (or perhaps stealing) jades and recarving them.\n\n1.  Spondylus Shell Earspool.  Mesoamerica, Maya.

Arnett\n\n2013 Reinstallation label:\nMaya Polychrome Ceramics\nDuring their height between 600 and 900 AD, the Maya created bowls (1, 2), tall beakers (3–5) and effigy flutes (6) painted with buff, orange, and black slip. Some were incised through the buff slip to the orange clay below, like 2, though most were painted (1, 3–5). The high degree of sophistication and artistic exploration characteristic of Late Classic Maya culture is clear when looking closely at the ceramic arts.

At the time they were stored in what were assumed to be their original boxes.  In some cases, original tags were found with the objects identifying the source.  In some cases there were no tags, but a tentative source was noted if other objects in the box had a source. X.0652 - X.0697 had no tags, but were found stored with other objects identified as being from W.H. Ferguson.  At the time of the 1990 inventory, it was decided to note the source for these as \"\"Ferguson (?)\"\".  Due to the inconclusive nature of this evidence, W.H. Ferguson does not appear as a constituent for these objects, but TMS still lists \"\"Gift of W.H. Ferguson(?) in the credit line field.\n\nAdditionally, in the W.H. Ferguson accession file, there is an old label that reads \"\"Indian Artifacts Donated to Emory University Museum by Mrs. Lois Rodgers. Found in Northern Arkansas. February 22, 1966\"\".  There is an additional handwritten note that states that during the 1990 inventory of the Native North American objects, none could be identified as having been donated by Lois Rodgers.  The handwritten note states that these objects may have been combined with W.H. Ferguson's objects.  It is possible that some of the objects in the X.0652-X.0697 group are some of these objects.\n\nAccording to the 1990 accession worksheet, X.0694.001-.012 were found in Box 65 and Box 72. According to an undated, handwritten inventory of the boxes, Box 65 contained \"\"8 rounded game stones, 11 grinders, 1 large mortar, 1 small mortar, 5 spear heads, 6 assorted axe heads, 4 holed stones – to attach to stick, Box #1 – 221 Arrowheads (Ferguson), Box #2 – 116 Arrowheads\"\".Box 72 contained \"\"1 pottery lid to jar, 1 large spearhead, 3 small axe heads, 1 large axe head, 1 mortar, 2 hollowed small stone, 37 game stones, 2 pieces fragmented pottery, Box #1 – assorted arrowheads, Box #3 - 40 arrowheads\"\".   It is unclear which objects in X.0694.001-.012 came from Box 65 and which came from Box 72.\n\n\nAt some point (believed to be in the late 1980s or early 1990s), a group of 35 Southeastern Native American objects were given to the Education Department for use in outreach programs. These objects were no longer tracked as part of the permanent collection. In the summer of 2021 a detailed survey Southeastern Native Americas collection and its museum documentation was started. The \"\"education collection\"\" objects were found in a plastic tub labeled \"\"Dig It' in the Tate Room closet. 30 of the objects were still in their plexi display boxes. Three stone objects were loose in the plastic tub. Two objects (X.0677 and X.0692.001) which are noted in TMS as in the education office were not located. One pottery fragment did not have an object number on it. At this time, this fragment cannot be matched up to any other numbers associated with the education collection. \n\nCurator Megan O'Neil requested that the objects be returned to the permanent collection and Director of Education, Elizabeth Hornor agreed.

One way in which he straddles these two realms is by physically incorporating into his work everyday objects-more often than not things he has found discarded in the street.  In the 1950s Rauschenberg created a series of works called Combines, because they mixed elements of both painting and sculpture, by attaching three-dimensional objects that might be as mundane as an old sock or as startling as a stuffed angora goat to canvas or wooden supports.   Later, working in two dimensions, the artist began to insert the real world into his work by transferring photographs and headlines from newspapers and popular magazines directly onto paper by rubbing them with solvent.  Beginning in 1962, when he was introduced to the technique by Andy Warhol, Rauschenberg began to reproduce these fragments of publications onto paper and canvas via the technique of silkscreen or screen printing.\n\nThroughout the 1960s Rauschenberg's work manifested an interest in politics and contemporary events, but as the decade wore on his attitude changed from one of  buoyant optimism to a growing unease that culminated in the series of prints shown here,  Surface Series (from Currents) and Features (from Currents).  Daily newspapers from major cities across the United States were the ¿real-world¿ materials that he used to make these works.  In January and February of 1970 he clipped headlines, articles, photographs, and advertisements from the New York Times, the New York Daily News, the Chicago Tribune, the Minneapolis Tribune, the San Francisco Examiner, the Los Angeles Times, and the Wall Street Journal. Once he had selected the texts and images, Rauschenberg assembled the cuttings into thirty-six collages, titled Currents. These collages were then photographed to produce screens for one colossal print and the two portfolios shown in this exhibition.  In these portfolios, Rauschenberg capitalized on the flexibility of the technique by using individual screens multiple times. This recycling of imagery is most striking in Surface Series where the layering of three screens in a single impression results in a dense and indistinct image.\n\nRauschenberg characterized these prints as ¿the most serious journalism I had ever attempted.¿  The two series, composed from the ephemeral medium of newspapers, form what is essentially a permanent scrapbook to convey his message about the deteriorating state of a world threatened by environmental hazards, racial violence, strife in the Middle East, and an unpopular war in Southeast Asia.   Just as in the daily paper, serious concerns compete with the trivial and merely lurid.   In Features (from Currents #55), a headline at the margin  recounts a criminal incident involving an ¿ex-coed¿ and  a ¿hippies' landlord,¿  while, more prominently, headlines about a Black Panther courtroom fracas and events in the conflict between Egypt and Israel frame a Peanuts cartoon and a photograph of a debonair Noel Coward.  By fixing the transient flux of current events in a work of art, Rauschenberg sought to more effectively focus public attention on the state of the world, or as he expressed it, ¿I made that series. . . because, knowing that it was art, people had to take a second look, at least, at the facts they were wrapping their garbage in.¿\n\nApril 1993 descriptor moved.\n\nHand printed silkscreens.

The cowrie shells that make up the fringe of each apron were imported from the East African coast. Bold, multi-hued, geometric patterns exemplify the 'Kirdi' apron style. The complex checkerboard compositions in 1,3, and 6 are based on international naval signal flags that were probably copied from a mission or school library book. Seven actual flag designs can be identified in 1, but flag patterns are also freely adapted to create innovative designs as seen in 3 and 6. When reconfigured in this novel art form, the beaded naval flag patterns communicate new kinds of messages. Worn around the waist during festive occasions, the patterns and colors of the aprons indicate  the wearer's ethnic affiliation and status in life as either an unwed girl, married woman, widow, or elder.  1-6  Aprons.

In ancient Peru the Nasca culture is well known for this: archaeologists find caches of skulls indicating actual stockpiling of “trophy heads.” Images in ceramic painting likewise illustrate such deceased and disembodied heads: 2 shows them with the characteristic slit eyes, jagged bloodstreams, wedges of loose black hair, and two vertical spines piercing the lips (to keep them closed during rigor mortis). They are shown upside down, a further indication that they are dead, i.e., in the afterlife, an inverted Underworld. The upright heads in 3 are also clearly dead, their features reduced to three lines and the whole background taken up with long black hair (used by living figures (4 and 5) to carry trophy heads).\nAll the heads in 4 are also deceased, with closed crescent-shaped eyes. Four heads also display the lip spines. However, one represents a disembodied head as the loincloth: to place one over a man’s genitals conflates life and death, suggesting not all such heads correspond to the war realm. (The head/loincloth is repeated on 6.) Other heads jut out from the long animal-headed emanation, an obviously non-terrestrial element that represents the shaman’s animal-self and/or bizarre bodily transformations experienced\nduring trance. Thus, heads also signify the visionary realm—shamans associate visions with the head since all the senses occur there, whereas the body may not be felt at all.\nReinforcing that not all heads are fully dead, on the back of the figures in 6 and held by the figure in 5 are heads that feature the pierced lips combined with open (i.e., living) eyes. These eyes feature pupils dangling from the upper lid, a common symbol for feline eyes, which do look like this. Jaguar and puma animal-selves are extremely common in shamanism since a powerful animal-self is most effective for curing illness, defeating lesser shamans, etc.\nLikewise, 1 features a lower row of feline-eyed heads, their mouths without spines, which are not shown dead in any way except being bodiless. They seem to be vision heads as well, impossibly shown half alive (open eyes) and half dead (spines on mouths); shamans freely traverse the worlds of the living and the dead during their out-of-body trances.

From foodgrinding platforms known as metates (11, 12) to weapons such as mace heads (5-7), from hand axes used to clear land (8-10) to bark beaters used to make cloth (3, 4), utilitarian forms were transformed into \"\"art-tools.\"\" Changes from the practical tool to the work of art range from adding imagery, such as birds to a metate (12) or a human figure to an axe (10), to reducing the tool to a miniature size (7, 8). Much more time and skill than was \"\"necessary\"\" was lavished on an axe head (1, 2) or the handle of a pestle (14). Yet neither a tiny mace head nor a dull ceremonial axe can really function at all.\n\nThese intriguing hybrid objects found throughout Costa Rican art seem to have been made in order to show the power of the high-status person over lower-status workers. Art-tools symbolize the woman?s grinding of flour, the warrior?s defense of his territory, and the farmer?s clearing of land by referring to their tools but transforming them into ceremonial versions. An agricultural axe becomes a necklace when made in a more precious material (10), but its shape is still easily recognizable to all and so effectively communicates the idea that the wearer has power over farming and, by extension, nature itself.  \n\n1.

An enormous number of bronze objects survive from ancient Iran and bear witness to a vigorous metalworking tradition existing after the mid-third millennium BC.  Between the second and first millennia, two regions in particular produced flourishing metalworking industries - the Gilan province of northern Iran and Luristan, a mountainous region of the central Zagros range in western Iran.  Each region produced a diverse and unique repertoire of weapons, tools, horsetrappings, jewelry, and objects of a personal and religious nature which displayed a distinctive artistic imagery.  The majority of bronze objects were either cast in the cire perdue (lost wax) technique or hammered from sheet metal and further decorated by use of a chisel or metal punch.  The small and portable nature of these objects was ideal for use by the nomadic and semi-nomadic herdsmen who inhabited the region along with more settled pastoralists, farmers, and horsebreeders.  The large numbers of objects deposited in tombs, the variety of object types, and the unique artistic imagery indicate further the preoccupation these peoples had with death and the afterlife, as well as the importance of the hunt, battle and horses.\n1-4. The rich tombs in the Gilan province of northern Iran have revealed large quantities of metalwork ranging from gold and silver bowls and beakers to bronze figurines of animals and weapons.  Daggers and spearheads of different shapes and sizes were extremely numerous and were left exclusively in graves belonging to men.  Unlike those at Luristan, bronze weapons lacked elaborate decoration and reflects an isolate, artistic tradition.\n8-15. The metalworkers of Luristan produced a wide variety of bronze objects which incorporated the stunning imagery of native animals and mythical beasts.  Animal forms ranged in style from natural to abstract and were generally cast or hammered into shape as zoomorphic handles or projections on weapons and tools.\n8. Since bronze required continual sharpening to maintain a useful edge, whetstones were an important piece of equipment used to hone the edges of daggers, swords, spears, arrows and axes.  Whetstone handles were often cast into zoomorphic representations or animals.  The ibex was the most popular choice, perhaps because of its most striking attribute - its sweeping curved horns.  In almost all cases, these were curved into a convenient loop from which the whetstone was suspended.\n10.  The importance of the horse in ancient Luristan is documented by the large number of surviving horse trappings and decorative harness fittings.  Cheekpieces, like this example, were attached to the harness bit and were often cast in a variety of forms ranging from horses, mouflons, and boars to mythical sphinxes, griffins, and master-of-animals.  Representations of figured cheekpieces appear on sculptured reliefs from Assyria, dating to the late eighth and seventh centruries BC, and indicate that these e fittings had a market outside of Luristan.\n11. At the turn of the first millennium BC, metalworkers often produced bi-metallic tools and weapons with blades made of iron and decorative elements cast in bronze.  This sword hilt's decorative elements consist of a circular pommel decorated with two bearded human and lion head and two crouching lions which form the dagger guard.  Nearly ninety iron examples of this sword type have been found and their complicated, unique, and nearly identical manufacture suggests a close association between the workshops in Luristan.12-14. Standard finials are the hallmark object of Luristan art and its bronze industry between the tenth and seventh centuries BC.  These objects were mounted on bottle-shaped supports by means of a central tube or pin and are meant to be seen from both sides.  Their iconography is striking, varying from rampant goats (12) and lions to the exotic master- or mistress-of-animals (13, 14) representations where abstract human-like bodies are fused with stylize lions, goats, birds, and mythical, fantastic beasts.  Only a few standard finials have been recovered from excavated tombs and sanctuaries and are best interpreted as representations of local gods, deities, or demons.\n1. Socketed Spearhead.

Each region produced a diverse and unique repertoire of weapons, tools, horse trappings, jewelry, and objects of a personal and religious nature that displayed a distinctive artistic imagery. The majority of bronze objects were either cast in the lost wax technique or hammered from sheet metal and further decorated by means of a chisel or metal punch. The small and portable nature of these objects was ideal for use by the nomadic and seminomadic herdsmen who inhabited the region along with more settled pastoralists, farmers, and horse breeders. The large numbers of objects deposited in tombs, the variety of object types, and the unique artistic imagery indicate further the preoccupation these peoples had with death and the afterlife, as well as the importance of the hunt, battle, and horses.\n\n1.

Spotted cats may be shown with the body as the bowl itself (1, 2, 6), may carry a bowl on the back (4, 5, 7), or may perch on a bowl that is portrayed as something else, such as a tree (3). Jaguars are skilled tree climbers, so 3 is not fantastical in any way.\n\nIn all these pieces, the feline's body is painted or incised to suggest spots, even though some appear to be stripes. There are no tigers in the Americas; however, the lower limbs and chest of a jaguar may appear somewhat striped, as smaller rosettes can fuse into lines, therefore a striped cat may still represent a jaguar. Other spotted felines existed in Costa Rica (margays, ocelots, and others), but jaguars are by far the largest and most impressive (an ocelot's weight is one-tenth that of a jaguar). A vessel like 7, with ears more pointed than rounded, may well represent a smaller feline, however.\n\nThe bowl may serve to hold the incense in an incense burner (4, 5), in which case the jaguar figure below acts as the legs. In this same Potosi style crocodilians perch on incense burner lids. There may be a distinction being drawn between the crocodile as the earth's surface, a widespread ancient American belief, and the jaguar as the king of the Underworld, also a broadly held idea. Jaguars are largely nocturnal, their spots resemble reversed stars, and they are avid swimmers, so the associations with the dark, wet night of the Underworld are strong. Given this cosmic structure, it would be natural to place jaguars below and crocodiles above in incense burner compositions.\n\nBy analogy with the Potosi examples, 5 may also be the base of a small incense burner. The pieces in which the bowl is the body (1, 2, 6) could have held almost anything, or nothing at all, in rituals or the burial. The prevalent belief in shamanism that all things are alive, including art, means that a vessel is complete even when empty. It may also have been envisioned to contain the ephemeral spirit of whatever it portrayed, in this instance the spirit of the jaguar, which is often considered the shaman's animal self.\n\n1.\tRectangular Bowl with Modeled Jaguar Heads.

Cofradia Mantel.\n\nTextile Rotation 2 label:\nMaya Textiles with Double-Headed Eagle Motifs\nAs seen in a textile in the Panamá gallery, the double-headed eagle, because it represented the ruling Hapsburg house, was introduced into Central and South America after the Spanish took control of “Latin” America. It appears as a recurrent theme in Maya brocade textiles, from Catholic altar cloths (1) to women’s blouses, known as huipiles (2). Although it is an imposed symbol with strong political overtones, the image of a bird with two heads would have resonated with ancient indigenous shamanic imagery—multi-headed phenomena are closely associated with visions and spirits from otherworldly realms. Double-headed “Vision Serpents” are found throughout ancient American art, for instance, as are bicephalic crocodilians, felines, and certainly birds, as seen throughout the galleries.\nAn altar cloth featuring a large Hapsburg eagle exemplifies the close ties between the Spanish crown and the post-Reformation Catholic mission, both of which overlaid and blended with native shamanism. In both pieces odd animals, like those seen in visions, are sprinkled in with recognizably Spanish images; the curly-tailed creatures alternating with the chalices in the huipil epitomize this creative juxtaposition of sacred imagery from both indigenous and foreign cultures. Furthermore, the eagle being spread among the diamonds, zigzags, and fantastical elements may dilute the superficial message of Spanish political power.

The vibrant purple was likely achieved by extracting pigment from sea snails (Plicopurpura pansa [see technical note]) that live along the eastern Pacific coast from Mexico to Perú.

There were, however, many settlements in existence along the Nile valley. Most of these are known today less from their living sites than from their cemeteries that were situated in the Upper Egyptian desert and are thus easily accessible to archaeologists.\n\nThe dead were buried in a contracted position in shallow pits dug in the sand and were surrounded by grave goods consisting of pots, which probably contained food and drink, and personal items like cosmetic palettes. These objects suggest that there was already a belief in the afterlife. \n\nThe preservative properties of the hot, desiccating sand may have convinced the Egyptians that the survival of the body was necessary for existence in the afterlife. Later, in the Dynastic Period, when the body was no longer surrounded directly by sand, but was placed in a specially constructed burial chamber, the normal processes of decay set in. When the Egyptians realized this, they began a search for an artificial way to keep the body intact that led to the invention of mummification.  \n\t\nSlate and schist palettes made in the form of animals such as birds and fish were common during the later predynastic period. They were used for grinding various ores, such as galena (lead sulphide) or malachite (copper carbonate) in order to produce eye make-up, which was worn by both men and women. \n\t\nFinely finished pottery in red and black was characteristic of the Upper Egyptian predynastic and formed part of an African ceramic tradition that continues through the present day. \n\n\n1.

The basalt axe shape was reinterpreted in jadeite (12, 13, 16, 17, 22, 23m, n, q, v) and related hard green stones. This elevated the agricultural tool to the highest form of art, as jadeite was the culture's most valued material. Human and animal imagery was carved on the handle and holes were drilled in from the sides to allow this elaborate axe to be worn. Other forms, especially beads, were also made to be necklaces (18-22). Artists drilled in from each end skillfully enough that the two holes met in the middle. People who could not afford such fine \njewelry were buried with crude imitations in softer stones (23a-w).\n\nWhat is most fascinating about making necklaces from axes is that the complete celt (4-6) was also subdivided in many ways and those pieces then worn as necklaces (7-17). This complex splitting process shows that the artist was able to make a complete celt and then to break it, despite the hardness of the material, so that the part still reflected its place in the original whole. The agricultural tool shape had to be honored since it was the key to the statement of power over nature made by the wearer. Half celts (7-9) are the front or the back face of a whole celt, made by carving a whole celt in from both sides until the front could be snapped off the back. The bumpy ridge, or septum, was left (9), as evidence of successful snapping. Then suspension holes were drilled and the human (8, 9) or bat (7) features carved on the upper part. Half celts may themselves be split further into quarter celts (13, 14) or even smaller units (15-17). A quarter celt is a half celt cut in half down the middle; it has a septum on both the inside and the back edges (14). A half celt may also be split into six to eight parts. These different ways of cutting up celts suggest that some kind of complex information was encoded in the process; scholars suspect that a person?s genetic or spiritual relationship to another was reflected in what piece of a whole celt that person wore. The whole celt could have been seen as the \"\"mother\"\" of the others, so, for example, the wearer of a quarter celt could be one of four \"\"children.\"\"\n\n1-3.  Utilitarian Celts.

The color of fertile vegetation and life-giving water, and long lasting in a moist tropical environment that rotted other materials, hard green stones were symbolic of life and longevity. Being arduous to carve as well, worked greenstone represented power over not only the stone but also over the artists’ time.\nMost greenstones were worked into a form that could be worn by elite males as pendants, their power visible from afar. Holes were laboriously drilled from each side, meeting in the middle (no mean feat), so as to be able to suspend the piece on a necklace (as seen in 1). However, the pendants’ shape was significant as well, being based on that of a utilitarian hand axe, a stone tool for clearing land. In a plain, totally utilitarian tool the top was roughened to create a good grip and the lower part acted as a blade; when converted into jewelry, the upper area became a human figure (3–8) or a bird (1, 2, 9), and the blade served as the lower body, sometimes with legs (5). This “art-tool” communicated that the wearer wielded power over agriculture, animals, and other humans.\nYet the Costa Rican lapidaries took these art-tools another step: in a unique practice they intentionally and laboriously split the decorated greenstone hand axe form into parts. Elites wore whole axes (1, 2) and half axes (3–5), the front and back separated off from wholes. The halves were also halved into quarters (6, 7), and thirds (8). Some thirds were separated from wholes (9) as well. Carvers cut in from the sides until only a thin wall separated the parts and split them off from each other, leaving the broken ridge of the wall or septum in the final product. This septum (visible in 4, shown from the back) was the proof that the carver had followed this production sequence; it meant that the pendant had been a whole axe at one time, that is, even though a fragment, it still held the power of the tool. “Process as product” is a key concept in ancient American art because the energy, skill, time, and intention of making an object was an inherent part of its life force, energy, and power. No step was arbitrary, as leaving the septum implies, and all contributed to the final product’s layers of meanings.\n1. Tufted Bird Whole-Celt Pendant\nCentral America, Greater Nicoya, Costa Rica.

The color of fertile vegetation and life-giving water, and long lasting in a moist tropical environment that rotted other materials, hard green stones were symbolic of life and longevity. Being arduous to carve as well, worked greenstone represented power over not only the stone but also over the artists’ time.\nMost greenstones were worked into a form that could be worn by elite males as pendants, their power visible from afar. Holes were laboriously drilled from each side, meeting in the middle (no mean feat), so as to be able to suspend the piece on a necklace (as seen in 1). However, the pendants’ shape was significant as well, being based on that of a utilitarian hand axe, a stone tool for clearing land. In a plain, totally utilitarian tool the top was roughened to create a good grip and the lower part acted as a blade; when converted into jewelry, the upper area became a human figure (3–8) or a bird (1, 2, 9), and the blade served as the lower body, sometimes with legs (5). This “art-tool” communicated that the wearer wielded power over agriculture, animals, and other humans.\nYet the Costa Rican lapidaries took these art-tools another step: in a unique practice they intentionally and laboriously split the decorated greenstone hand axe form into parts. Elites wore whole axes (1, 2) and half axes (3–5), the front and back separated off from wholes. The halves were also halved into quarters (6, 7), and thirds (8). Some thirds were separated from wholes (9) as well. Carvers cut in from the sides until only a thin wall separated the parts and split them off from each other, leaving the broken ridge of the wall or septum in the final product. This septum (visible in 4, shown from the back) was the proof that the carver had followed this production sequence; it meant that the pendant had been a whole axe at one time, that is, even though a fragment, it still held the power of the tool. “Process as product” is a key concept in ancient American art because the energy, skill, time, and intention of making an object was an inherent part of its life force, energy, and power. No step was arbitrary, as leaving the septum implies, and all contributed to the final product’s layers of meanings.\n1. Tufted Bird Whole-Celt Pendant\nCentral America, Greater Nicoya, Costa Rica.

Myth served as a means for understanding one's history, social structures, and place in the world.  Closely connected to religion, it played an integral role in many facets of daily life.\n\nArt serves as a key source for our knowledge of classical mythology.  Images of gods and heroes appear in a variety of visual media, including sculpture, wall painting, vase painting, mosaics, and coins.  Deities or heroes may be shown alone (1-2, 4) or in narrative scenes of myth (5).  We are able to recognize particular figures by identifying elements called attributes, by age and dress, and by the specific scenes in which they appear.  For example, a hunter and a woman shown with a boar's head and pelt on a Roman mirror (5) create a scene from the myth of the Calydonian Boar Hunt.\n\nThe marble head (1) and terracotta statuette (2) seen in this case both depict the hero Herakles, or Hercules as he was known in Roman mythology.  Both representations reflect the attitude of the famous fourth-century statue, the \"\"Weary Herakles\"\" by Lysippos.  The now-lost original statue depicted the aging Herakles leaning on his club, exhausted after having completed his twelve labors.  In his right hand, placed behind his back, Herakles held the apples of the Hesperides, the fruits of his penultimate labor and symbol of the immortality he would be granted by Zeus (Jupiter).  One of the most popular monuments of Greek sculpture, the \"\"Weary Herakles\"\" was much reproduced, from its own time through the Roman Empire.\n\n The mirror (5) and sarcophagus fragment (3) both feature narrative hunt scenes.

Images of boar hunting appear frequently on Roman sarcophagi, with the heroized hunter suggesting the strength, courage, and noble character of the deceased.  Often such scenes represent the great mythological hunters Meleager,  Hippolytos,  or  Adonis.  Unfortunately,  too  little  of  this  relief survives to determine if the original composition represented a mythological encounter.  The mirror (5), however, certainly shows a rare scene from the myth of hunting the Calydonian Boar, the ferocious beast sent to ravage the countryside by the angry goddess Artemis (Diana).  The virgin huntress Atalanta wounded the boar first; the king's son Meleager killed it but offered to share its pelt and head with Atalanta, whom he loved deeply.  The scene here shows the boar's head resting on a rustic altar between the lovers and before a statue of Artemis, goddess of the hunt.  The tone of the scene is quiet and intimate, as befits a personal object; we can contrast the crowded and complex composition of the sarcophagus fragment.\n\n1. Head of Herakles.

Myth served as a means for understanding one's history, social structures, and place in the world.  Closely connected to religion, it played an integral role in many facets of daily life.\n\nArt serves as a key source for our knowledge of classical mythology.  Images of gods and heroes appear in a variety of visual media, including sculpture, wall painting, vase painting, mosaics, and coins.  Deities or heroes may be shown alone (1-2, 4) or in narrative scenes of myth (5).  We are able to recognize particular figures by identifying elements called attributes, by age and dress, and by the specific scenes in which they appear.  For example, a hunter and a woman shown with a boar's head and pelt on a Roman mirror (5) create a scene from the myth of the Calydonian Boar Hunt.\n\nThe marble head (1) and terracotta statuette (2) seen in this case both depict the hero Herakles, or Hercules as he was known in Roman mythology.  Both representations reflect the attitude of the famous fourth-century statue, the \"\"Weary Herakles\"\" by Lysippos.  The now-lost original statue depicted the aging Herakles leaning on his club, exhausted after having completed his twelve labors.  In his right hand, placed behind his back, Herakles held the apples of the Hesperides, the fruits of his penultimate labor and symbol of the immortality he would be granted by Zeus (Jupiter).  One of the most popular monuments of Greek sculpture, the \"\"Weary Herakles\"\" was much reproduced, from its own time through the Roman Empire.\n\n The mirror (5) and sarcophagus fragment (3) both feature narrative hunt scenes.  The stone fragment, carved in high relief, preserves the upper bodies of two hunters-one on horseback-who close in on a boar that rushes to the right.  Images of boar hunting appear frequently on Roman sarcophagi, with the heroized hunter suggesting the strength, courage, and noble character of the deceased.  Often such scenes represent the great mythological hunters Meleager,  Hippolytos,  or  Adonis.  Unfortunately,  too  little  of  this  relief survives to determine if the original composition represented a mythological encounter.  The mirror (5), however, certainly shows a rare scene from the myth of hunting the Calydonian Boar, the ferocious beast sent to ravage the countryside by the angry goddess Artemis (Diana).  The virgin huntress Atalanta wounded the boar first; the king's son Meleager killed it but offered to share its pelt and head with Atalanta, whom he loved deeply.  The scene here shows the boar's head resting on a rustic altar between the lovers and before a statue of Artemis, goddess of the hunt.  The tone of the scene is quiet and intimate, as befits a personal object; we can contrast the crowded and complex composition of the sarcophagus fragment.\n\n1. Head of Herakles.

The communities grew steadily, nowhere more so than at Constantinople, the city inaugurated with massive ambition by Constantine in 324 AD on the site of a former Greek city, Byzantium, as the capital of the Eastern part of the Roman Empire. Constantinople survived the Germanic invasions of Rome in the fifth century and lent its earlier name, Byzantium, to an important and sophisticated culture that would last until 1453 AD when Turkish troops led by Sultan Mehmed II finally broke through the city walls. The flight of the nobility and intellectual elite from Constantinople to Western Europe was a major force in the emergence of the Italian Renaissance.\n\n\nThe pantheon of Olympian gods, however, continued to attract worshippers well beyond 313 AD, particularly in remoter parts. The earliest material evidence for the profound change to a monotheistic religion, Christianity, can be sense in pottery made in Roman North Africa. Alongside representations of myths familiar from the classical world (17-22), we encounter commemoration of individuals like Thecla (25), a disciple of St. Paul, and the appearance of Christograms (23-24). The cross on the intaglio (36) denotes an early Christian family probably living in the Eastern fringes of the Roman Empire.\n\n\n\n1. Standard Fitting with Busts of Sol, Luna, and Saturn.

Here art from Peru (1) and Colombia (2–6) is represented (Ecuador, in the next gallery). These pieces underscore that images of powerful females characterize this important zone and that gold was highly valued and impeccably worked.\nThe Peruvian female shaman figure (1) has wide, whiterimmed “trance” eyes. Modern shamans report visionary transformation into an animal-self and here her square head, short arms, and white spots on a brown background suggest that it was the world’s largest fish, the whale shark (Rhincodon typus). The brown open mouth with serrated teeth painted across her jaw aptly depicts the whale shark’s giant maw, filled with thousands of tiny, shark-like teeth. Even the white line down her back corresponds to the white edge of the whale shark’s dorsal fin. To have the powers of such a mighty animal —females, larger than the males, can reach over forty feet long—would have been impressive indeed.\nColombia is renown for having one of the planet’s largest gold sources. The nosering (6), ear rod (5), and labret (4) mask the lower face by dangling a lightweight beaten gold sheet from the septum, decorating the earlobe with a cylindrical earring pushed through a large hole, and elaborating the area between the mouth and chin with an inserted flange, respectively. Gold, not only reflective but extremely permanent, defying tarnish for millennia, signaled elevated social status. Jewelry was buried with the body, in the widespread Amerindian belief that the soul went to an afterlife with his or her possessions.\nThe large urns (1, 3) were buried containing the bones, the similarly permanent body parts, and the gold of the deceased. Expressing the deceased’s hope of being reborn on the Other Side, images of powerful females are typical in burial urn imagery.

With an accentuated navel as well as delineated genitalia, 1 shows that women also played key spiritual roles.\n1.

Representation of crocodiles. The earlier repair on the piece is breaking. Worth fixing.\n\nComment on condition:\nNeeds help.\n\nPermanent collection gallery:\nCrocodiles, Real and Unreal \n\nOnly a few of the many works of art from ancient Costa Rica represent the crocodile as it appears in nature (5, 6), while most give the creature two heads (1, 2, 4, 7).  Crocodiles shown more realistically, such as the pair of matched flutes (5, 6), feature the upturned heads, protruding eyes and nostrils, long teeth-filled jaws, and the body ridges characteristic of this awesome reptile.  However, in these pieces the tails are necessarily shortened so as to function as a mouthpiece.\n\nIn the double-headed images, which are much more common, the symmetrical heads serve as matching handles for bowls (1, 2), tripod vessels (7), or the bench on which a figure sits (4). However, this practical design feature does not explain the choice of the fantastical; a tail would work as a handle as well as another head. In the shamanic art of the ancient Americas, double-headed creatures, especially snakes and crocodilians, are ubiquitous. They may reflect the fact that all kinds of frightening things are experienced during the shaman's ritual trance, including bizarre attacking crocodiles. \n\nThe figure on the bench (4) is a key to this association of the supernatural with the two-headed crocodile. It depicts a female shaman whose popping eyes and bumpy head seem to suggest those features of the crocodile. Her legs are transforming into faces, and a snake encircles her waist. One hand-with ten fingers!-grasps a cup that might have held a mind-altering substance. She is a shaman in a trance, melding her human self with her animal one, and it is significant that she is elevated on a bench that sports two crocodile heads. This kind of bench has not been found archaeologically, so it may have been made of wood instead of a permanent material like stone. Another piece (7) joins the bicephalic (two-headed) crocodile with a painted bird design, probably a reference to shamanic trances that also involve a sense of flying like a bird.\n\nShamans as dual beings, both crocodile and human, are depicted in 3. Diving downward, as if into the watery underworld, the applique figures feature human faces and arms along with ridged crocodile tails and back feet.\n\n1. \tFooted Shallow Bowl with Double Crocodile Heads. \n\tCentral America, Costa Rica, Atlantic Watershed, El Rio Applique. \t\t\tPeriod V, AD 500-800.

Thibadeau\n\n2013 Reinstallation Label:\nAndean Art\nThe ancient Andean cultural region encompassed the modern countries of Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia, plus parts of Bolivia, Argentina, and Chile. Here art from Peru (1) and Colombia (2–6) is represented (Ecuador, in the next gallery). These pieces underscore that images of powerful females characterize this important zone and that gold was highly valued and impeccably worked.\nThe Peruvian female shaman figure (1) has wide, whiterimmed “trance” eyes. Modern shamans report visionary transformation into an animal-self and here her square head, short arms, and white spots on a brown background suggest that it was the world’s largest fish, the whale shark (Rhincodon typus). The brown open mouth with serrated teeth painted across her jaw aptly depicts the whale shark’s giant maw, filled with thousands of tiny, shark-like teeth. Even the white line down her back corresponds to the white edge of the whale shark’s dorsal fin. To have the powers of such a mighty animal —females, larger than the males, can reach over forty feet long—would have been impressive indeed.\nColombia is renown for having one of the planet’s largest gold sources. The nosering (6), ear rod (5), and labret (4) mask the lower face by dangling a lightweight beaten gold sheet from the septum, decorating the earlobe with a cylindrical earring pushed through a large hole, and elaborating the area between the mouth and chin with an inserted flange, respectively. Gold, not only reflective but extremely permanent, defying tarnish for millennia, signaled elevated social status. Jewelry was buried with the body, in the widespread Amerindian belief that the soul went to an afterlife with his or her possessions.\nThe large urns (1, 3) were buried containing the bones, the similarly permanent body parts, and the gold of the deceased. Expressing the deceased’s hope of being reborn on the Other Side, images of powerful females are typical in burial urn imagery. Here an egg-shaped pregnant women (3), her navel everted, and nude meditating female shaman (1) show different sides of female authority. With an accentuated navel as well as delineated genitalia, 1 shows that women also played key spiritual roles.\n1.

Its natural defenses and the availability of water made the site desirable as a citadel and dwelling place. It has been continuously inhabited\nsince Neolithic times, ca. 5000 bc. By the early sixth century bc it had become a sanctuary sacred to the goddess Athena. In 480 bc the Persians invaded Athens, and the Acropolis was overrun, its temples, dedications, and sculptures all\ndestroyed and burned. The monuments now visible on its summit are the remnants of a grand building scheme begun in the middle of the fifth century bc under the statesman Perikles, after the defeat of Persia and the rise of Athens to empire. From left to right on the summit are the Erechtheion, the Parthenon, the Propylaia, and the small temple of Athena Nike, all constructed between 447 and 404 bc in white\nmarble quarried from Mount Pentelicon northeast of Athens. The dark tower just to the left of the temple of Athena Nike is the so-called Frankish Tower, built by a Florentine family, the Acciaiuoli, who ruled as Dukes of Athens from the late\nfourteenth century until the Ottoman conquest in 1458.\n\nThe Eye of Greece intro text:\nThe Eye of Greece\nAthens in Nineteenth-Century Photographs\nWhen the English poet John Milton called Athens ¿the eye of Greece, Mother of Arts and Eloquence¿ in Paradise Regained (1671), he echoed the opinion of untold generations who had looked on the city as the center of culture and civilization ever since its rise to greatness under the statesman Perikles in the fifth century bc. It was Perikles who initiated the building program that would raise new gleaming white marble monuments-the Parthenon, the Propylaia, the Erechtheion, the Temple of Athena Nike-on top of the Acropolis. These works were to be admired and emulated by later Athenians, by Hellenistic princes, and by Roman emperors for almost a thousand years. The triumph of Christianity in the fifth century ad meant that the monuments were put to new uses; pagan temples became churches. The conquest of Greece by the Ottoman Empire in the fifteenth century brought more changes; the Parthenon was converted to a mosque. Following the liberation of Greece from Turkish rule, the Acropolis was declared an archaeological site, and the marble monuments of Perikles began in 1834 to be freed from the structures that had accumulated in the most recent thousand years.\nFive years later, in 1839, a new method of representation was invented and given a name derived from the Greek: photography (literally, ¿light writing¿). By the end of that year a Canadian had made the first daguerreotypes of the Parthenon. Many more photographers were soon to follow. Only three of the photographers whose pictures are displayed here can be identified. Dimitris Constantine (Greek, active 1855-72) was among the first native photographers in the city and was also the first official photographer for the Greek Archaeological Society. William Stillman (American, 1828-1901), a journalist, sometime diplomat, and painter, proved himself a gifted amateur photographer with the 1870 publication of The Acropolis of Athens, which showed the monuments from novel points of view. Felix Bonfils (French, 1831-1885) opened a photography studio in Beirut, Lebanon in 1867. His work was widely distributed, purchased by tourists and armchair travelers alike. He is best known for his photographs of Egypt and the Holy Land, but he also included several images of Athens in albums published in the 1870s. All of these photographers, including those whose names are unknown, have preserved for new generations the ancient monuments as they looked at this moment in their history.\n\nObjects in Lot 1:\n1985.023.011\nX.0019.001\nX.0019.005\nX.0019.006\nX.0019.007\nX.0019.008\nX.0019.009\nX.0019.011\nX.0019.013\nX.0019.016\nX.0019.017\nX.0019.018\nX.0019.019\nX.0019.020\nX.0019.021\nX.0019.026\nX.0019.027\nX.0019.029\nX.0019.032\nX.0019.033\nX.0019.035\nX.0019.036\nX.0019.037\nX.0019.041\nX.0019.046\nX.0019.047\nX.0019.048\nX.0019.049\nX.0019.052\nX.0019.053\nX.0019.054\nX.0019.055\nX.0019.056\nX.0019.058\nX.0019.060\nX.0019.062\nX.0019.063\nX.0019.064\nX.0019.065\nX.0019.066\nX.0019.070 A/B\n\nNo provenance information in files.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Subjectivity bias.

Sometimes dipped in black or red pigment, these cones were inserted side by side in a thick mud plaster to form mosaic-like patterns with geometric desings of zigzags, lozenges and triangles.\"\"\n\nThe Art of Mesopotamia.  The land of Mesopotamia embraced the region of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers and spawned a diverse succession of cultures, cities and empires.  Between the third and first millennia B.C., Sumerians, Akkadians, Babylonians (including the Amorites, Kassites, and Chaldeans), and Assyrians stamped their identities in the historical and archaeological record of the region, leaving a rich cultural and artistic legacy.  The artistic traditions of Mesopotamia display an underlying unity that was partially shaped by available materials and resources, ranging from the abundant mudbrick and clay of the region to semi-precious imported stone.  Much of Mesopotamian art was rooted in concepts of religion, kingship, and ritual where specialized architecture (2) and major art, ranging from statues (4, 5), sculptured relief (6), cylinder seals (3), and luxury items (7-10) were created and dedicated to service palaces, temples, or shrines of major gods and deities.  More popular art, in the form of statuettes, plaque figurines (13, 14), seals, amulets, and charms were used outside official centers of worship for private and domestic use.\n2. The abundance of mudbrick and the general lack of good timber and stone in Mesopotamia helped shape the development of architectural forms and decoration.  During the later fourth millennium, Mesopotamian builders often enriched the walls of temples with tens of thousands of small clay cones.  Sometimes dipped in black or red pigment, these cones were inserted side by side in a thick mud plaster to form mosaic-like patterns with geometric designs of zigzags, lozenges, and triangles.\n4, 5. Numerous small-scale votive statues survive from the Early Dynastic period, ca. third millennium B.C. These were dedicated by men and women to temples and shrines of local gods to represent the worshipper and commemorate the devotion of individual donors.\n6. The there of the ¿banquet¿ figured prominently in Mesopotamian art during the Early Dynastic period, appearing on cylinder seals, decorative inlay panels, and relief plaques.  The theme is illustrated on this relief fragment where a seated figure in a fringed kilt holds a plant and a cup which is being handed to or received from a male attendant.  The banquet theme has often been associated with sacred marriage ceremonies or a victory feast before or after a battle.  This fragment probably belonged to a plaque, usually square with a central hole, that served as a socket for a door locking mechanism used in temples and other important buildings of the period.\n7-9.  The manufacture and use of stone vessels continued in Mesopotamia even after the introduction of pottery.  High quality, workable stone was a rare commodity in the region.  Some stone vessels were made locally from imported stone but many were made abroad and probably contained luxury products.  The vessels themselves were valued and highly prized nad were often inscribed as dedications to temples or deposited as grave offerings.\n10.  Seven ostrich egg vessels were recovered out of some 150 graves at the Early Dynastic site of Kish, one of the principal Sumerian city-states.  This highly prized vessel type was made by slicing off the top of an ostrich egg and attaching a base and rim of clay covered with bitumen plaster, a pitch-like substance, that was inlayed with mother-of-pearl, cut from a mussel still common in the Euphrates River.  Though inlay decoration is rarely found on vessels, it was a popular ornamental technique used by Early Dynastic craftsmen.\n11, 12. Mold-made clay plaques were mass-produced during the second millennium B.C. for use in temples, tombs and houses.  Demons and deities were often depicted on plaques (11) as illustrated here by Nergal, god of the underworld, who is recognizable by the divine horned cap and his hand-held attributes, a scimitar and lion-headed scepter.  Among Nergal's many roles was his association with fevers and plagues, and his representation on a plaque may have offered protection against disease and death.  Animals (12), such as lions, were also featured on plaques serving not only a protective function but also representing a metaphor or symbol for deities with warlike functions.\n13-16.  Animal figurines and models of houses, beds, boats, chariots, and carts were popular during the third through first millennia B.C., and were used as votive offerings in temples, funerary gifts or toys.  The context of certain animal figurines such as rams (13), bulls, and boars in temple settings may reflect their symbolic sacrificial nature.  Models of boats (14) and chariots (15), the two most common modes of transportation in Mesopotamia, were also common and may have represented votive offerings for a safe journey.  Models of beds (16) sometimes with representation of a nude female or an embracing couple, perhaps reflected a desire or offering for fertility or good health.\n13-16.  Stone weights were frequently used in business transactions throughout Mesopotamia for measuring specific quantities of goods.  One of the most popular forms was a waterfowl, a common sight in the marshes of southern Mesopotamia.\n1. Sickle.  Ur.  Ubaid, 5500-4300 BC.  Clay.  American Scientific Mission, 1920.  1921.150\n2.

Much of Mesopotamian art was rooted in concepts of religion, kingship, and ritual brought down to us through cuneiform tablets, statues, sculpted reliefs, and cylinder seals. Many objects were created and dedicated to serve palaces, temples, or shrines of major gods and deities. Others were produced to adorn the dwellings of the living and the dead.\nDuring the later fourth millennium, Mesopotamian builders often enlivened the walls of temples with tens of thousands of small clay cones. Sometimes dipped in black or red pigment, these cones were inserted side by side in a thick mud plaster to form mosaic-like patterns with geometric designs of zigzags, lozenges, and triangles. Hundreds of clay tablets in the form of cylinders or cones were inserted into the walls and foundations of temples and palaces. They bore commemorative inscriptions and recorded the name of the builder, usually a king, and often lengthy recitals of historical and cultic events.\nMold-made clay plaques were mass-produced during the second millennium BC for use in temples, palaces, houses, and tombs. They were part of a door-locking system for important buildings. The plaque, usually square with a central hole that served as a socket for the lock, was embedded in a doorjamb. A peg was then inserted into the central opening and held a hook or cord that secured the door and was covered with clay impressed by one or more seals.\nThe theme of the ¿banquet¿ figured prominently on these plaques and on other forms of Mesopotamian art during the Early Dynastic period, including cylinder seals and decorative inlay panels. The banquet theme has often been associated with sacred marriage ceremonies or feasts before or after a battle. Numerous small scale temple and shrine votive statues representing worshipers have survived as well from the Early Dynastic period, ca. third millennium BC.\n\n1. Plaque with Banquet Scene. Sumerian.

Both media seem practical in their uses, but achieve elevated aesthetic status in their interpretations.  High technical achievement in both art forms was characteristic, despite the simple stone and wood tools with which they were created. Beautifully incised ceramic spindle whorls (1) were mounted on long, thin, wooden spindles and used to hold the thread during spinning.  Their individualized patterning shows that even functional objects related to textile production were seen as worthy of artistic treatment.  The intricately woven belt (5) also exceeds practical requirements with its high thread count and detailed designs. Gold and copper were hammered (2, 3) and cast (4) into objects of great delicacy.  Nose ornaments (2) hung off the septum to cover much of the face, which was kept free of hair by the use of tweezers (3).  The lightness and flexibility of gold alloy made it possible for them to fulfill these uses, while the immutable shine of plain expanses and raised designs made them markers of high social status.  In later ancient times another copper alloy we call bronze was used for such items as bells (4), remarkably cast with the clappers inside.  1.  Spindle Whorls.

Textiles were valued so highly that these tools were themselves made into works of art. The term \"\"art-tool' describes this type of practical aesthetic object that is characteristic of all ancient American cultures.\n\nFirst, to spin the thread, spindles (1-4) were carved from wood and spindle whorls (6-16) modeled from clay. A spindle is a thin, smooth stick that the spinner turns around to give twist to the strands of raw fiber. The spindle winds the thread onto its shaft above a bead or cylinder, a spindle whorl (3, 6-16). A bit of unspun fiber, wrapped around the shaft, serves to hold the spindle whorl in place (2). The spindle can be used as a bobbin (4), carrying the thread during the weaving process.\n\nBoth spindles and whorls were decorated in the Andes. The spindles were painted with stripes (visible only before the thread was made or after the bobbin was emptied). The whorls were incised with geometric patterns. Like the \"\"invisible\"\" spindle decoration, the whorl's patterns are not seen by the spinner, as the decorated side is down. Andean cultures valued art that was not necessarily visible to humans, as part of their belief in the shamanic visions that were not accessible to most people.\n\nWeaving also necessitated tools, such as flat wooden battens (5), used both to pick up particular warp threads for elaborate patterns and to pack down the wefts to achieve a dense cloth. Carved at the wide end, battens were also treated as simple works of art in their own right.\n\n1-4 Spindles.  South America, Central Andes, Central Coast.  Date unknown.

Although the subject of this one (17) is not known, the Spanish described quipus as recording the census, tribute, and crops, as well as astronomy, history, and poetry. As we know from computers, based only on zeros and ones, all information can be reduced to numbers, whether quantities and codes or abstract concepts. In fact, Inka mathematics and ours are identical base-10 systems, with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, fractions, and zero.\n\nEqually abstract geometric designs covered the clothing of Inka administrators. This pattern (18), known as the Inka Key, features four squares, two of which are connected by a diagonal line. The Inka called their vast empire Tawantinsuyu [tah-wahn-tin-soo-yoo], the Land of the Four Quarters, an idea encapsulated by this pattern. The high-status men who wore this tunic oversaw the world's largest empire in AD 1500.   \n\n17.  Quipu (Knot Record). Central Andes, Inka. Late Horizon,   AD 1430-1534.

This memo did not discuss the X.0600-X.0697 numbered objects, as the sources and provenance of those objects had been discussed in a March 1990 memo.  Information regarding the objects in the 1997 memo came from the Accession Log I (green-blue colored ledger) and old accession sheets. According to Lori's memo it was unclear when the accession log was started, but it was on or prior to 1984.  The accession worksheets had been created in 1984.\n\nAccording to Lori's memo, the designation of Etowah as provenance and Phillips Academy as source on the accession worksheets seemed arbitrary and not based on prior museum records.  Therefore the designation of Etowah or Phillips Academy based solely on the accession worksheets may be suspect. Below is a summary of what was found for this object.\n\nX.0288-X.0351 - According to the memo, the accession log lists Phillips Academy as source; all are listed as from Etowah.  I reviewed the accession log as well, and found that it listed Phillips Academy as source, but no mention of Etowah. There is no mention of accession worksheets in the memo.\n\nThere is a 1984 accession worksheet in the object file for X.0309. It notes the provenance as \"\"Georgia, Etowah Mounds, Tumlin Village Site\"\". It also notes the \"\"Field Number\"\" as \"\"Box 41\"\". The cigar box note associated with Box 41 reads \"\"Pottery Fragments Tumlin Village Site and a few other objects\"\" As X.0309 was not accounted for in the 1989/1990 inventory of the cigar boxes, it is presumed that it was not returned to the box after the 1984 worksheet was created. From the 1984 worksheets and the 1989/1990 inventory, Box 41 originally contained X.0309 and X.0612.001-.002.\n\nThe memos from the 1990s do not mention the \"\"Specimen Record\"\" worksheets housed in the blue fabric-covered binders. A few of these worksheets contain notes added by Lori Iliff in 1994.  It is unclear why these worksheets are not mentioned in the 1990s memos, but for completeness, their information is noted here.  It is however, unclear when these worksheets were created, by whom, and where the information in the worksheets came from.  Many have notes regarding packing objects for storage in 1982, so it can be assumed these were created in 1982 or earlier. At this time, no Specimen Records have been located for X.0288-X.0351.\n\n\nAt some point (believed to be in the late 1980s or early 1990s), a group of 35 Southeastern Native American objects were given to the Education Department for use in outreach programs. These objects were no longer tracked as part of the permanent collection. In the summer of 2021 a detailed survey Southeastern Native Americas collection and its museum documentation was started. The \"\"education collection\"\" objects were found in a plastic tub labeled \"\"Dig It' in the Tate Room closet. 30 of the objects were still in their plexi display boxes. Three stone objects were loose in the plastic tub. Two objects (X.0677 and X.0692.001) which are noted in TMS as in the education office were not located. One pottery fragment did not have an object number on it. At this time, this fragment cannot be matched up to any other numbers associated with the education collection. \n\nCurator Megan O'Neil requested that the objects be returned to the permanent collection and Director of Education, Elizabeth Hornor agreed.

Women (1, 2, 4, 5) are identified by their exposed breasts, and men by their genitalia (1); however, sex is not always made explicit (3, 5). Sometimes when the gender of a figure is not indicated, it may be inferred from other images. For instance, the small heads around the rim of 5 are assumed to be male because of the male head-taker sculptures made at the same time. Other indicators, such as the wearing of jewelry, are not consistent with our expectations: ancient Costa Rican men were more heavily ornamented than women. For example, men wore the greenstone ceremonial celt necklaces (2, 3). \n\nImages that combine male and female figures may feature dancing and music making (1), or more abstractly convey the cycle of life and death (5). The nude women in 1 dance with their hands on their thighs and seem to sing with open mouths, while the men play flutes. Together they served as the supports for a pot (no longer present, it would have fit into the ring above their heads). Likewise, in 5, a large oval metate (grinding platform), the women form the legs that support the plate, most likely used for making maize into flour. Their hands rest on their bellies in a gesture of fertility (perhaps one of the messages of the piece being that the maize food nourishes the generations of mothers and children). Female images made into vessels (4) also explicitly combine human fertility (her navel is everted as in pregnancy) with plentiful food. The woman as a vessel for life is aptly conveyed. \n\nThe tiny severed heads that encircle the metate's plate seem to represent the simultaneous giving and taking of life, in a probable analogy with the harvesting of maize kernels. Thus, through the metaphors of humans and maize the cycle of life itself is celebrated. The same kind of festive action in 1 may be related to the food stored in the pot above the dancers. Certainly in pre-industrial society a full food jar or a good harvest ready to be processed on a milling stone were key to survival and power. Men's and women's complementary contributions to this success were honored in ancient Costa Rican art.   \n\n1.  Pot Stand with Ring of Dancing Figures and Large Birds.

Thibadeau\n\n2013 Reinstallation label:\nWomb Vessels\nIn pre-industrial societies group survival depended on maximizing the fertility of women. Among the chiefdoms of ancient Costa Rica successful pregnancy and infant viability were concerns apparent especially in vessels, which naturally echo the idea of containment, the female body, and here, the womb itself.\nA bulging effigy pot (3) appropriately becomes a pregnant woman’s body, the everted (popped out) navel signaling the third trimester and thus a positive, full-term gestation. Hands cradling her swollen belly capture a familiar motherly gesture as well as symbolize the protection of the precious life within; this pose is adopted by many Costa Rican female images and some male images meant to cross gender categories. Geometric body paint creates a second, two-dimensional reading of thin arms and a stepped torso, perhaps referring to women’s impressive ability to repeatedly shrink and swell during the reproductive years. Either reading draws attention to the breasts and navel, doubly framed by both types of arms. \nThe other vessels (1, 2, 4–6) constitute even more overt images of woman-as-womb, and their use underscores the anxiety and hope that surrounded childbirth in antiquity. Recently archaeologists have identified the function and meaning of these odd asymmetrical vessels. They were buried with the skeletons of fetuses, newborns, and children nestled inside them, confirming they represent the hoped-for rebirth of a young life tragically lost. The vessel shape strongly echoes the distended torso of pregnancy, again the navel and nipples very prominent (6). Rough, incised surface texture easily stands for stretch marks, or straie gravidarum, which are more pronounced in darker-skinned women.\nAppliqué lines curving out to either side (4, 5) resemble fallopian tubes; a non-perceptual, interior (‘x-ray’) view is common in ancient American art, especially apt here since the subject is the child inside the womb. An added face may be that of the deceased baby within or its living spirit. The baby on 5 wears large round earspools, a status symbol underscoring the infant’s preciousness.\nOther images add larger concepts of life and death. A twisted motif (1) may stand for the umbilical cord; however, in much of Costa Rican art the visions-producing vine B. caapi/inebrians is depicted similarly. This may signify that a shaman during vine-induced visions could contact, protect, and/ or bring back the baby’s soul. The animal face (2) belongs to a coati, a burrowing rodent that is the patron of the buriers of bodies in traditional Costa Rican mythology and ritual.

After an initial burial, the skeletal remains were placed inside an urn, and buried on an anniversary of the death, a practice referred to as secondary burial. Bodily remains were considered crucial for rebirth (the words for \"\"bone\"\" and \"\"seed\"\" are the same in most of the languages of this area). Hence the bones held within an image of a pregnant woman (2), identifiable by her everted navel, aptly symbolize the cycle of life. Gold is likewise an \"\"immortal\"\" substance that does not tarnish, corrode, or fade over time. Hence gold jewelry, such as earrings (4), nose rings (5), and labrets (lip plugs) (6), was another element the soul was believed to need in the afterlife.   \n\n1, 3.Negative-Painted Secondary Burial Urns.

Thibadeau\n\n2013 Reinstallation label:\nArt of Ancient Ecuador\nEcuador, between Colombia and Peru, is considered part of the Northern Andes in ancient times, though it was partly conquered by the Inka in the sixteenth century. It was a very creative area, making female figurines (2, 3) and weaving cloth on looms (represented by the skirt depicted in 6) well before adjacent regions. Some of its practices relate to the Colombian and lower Central American cultures, such as secondary burial in large urns (1, 7) and roller stamped body decoration (5). Secondary burial means the deceased was allowed to decompose and the bones placed in giant vessels, which were then buried on the anniversary of the death. The face painted on 7 suggests the reanimation of these permanent body parts on the Other Side; indeed, the word for “bone” is the word for “seed” in this area, expressing the idea that the bones will grow another person.\nMany distinct styles followed one another in Ecuador, from the early expressive Chorrera [cho rare rah] (4, 8) dated 700–300 bc, to the later, delicate Jama-Coaque [hah mah co wa kay] (6). The seated Chorrera figure (8) shuts his eyes, holds his mirror necklace, and displays quids of coca in his cheeks, all indications that he is a shaman in trance (mirrors were divination tools and coca was used to maintain consciousness for lengthy rituals). The standing Jama-Coaque female effigy (6) represents a high-status woman in a turban, wrapped skirt, and gold jewelry. The clay slabs standing for cloth draping between her head and shoulders are impressive—clay dries at different rates and such suspended parts are prone to destruction from the moment they are created. Post-fired paint suggests the bright yellow headwrap and black skirt of a beautifully adorned young woman, whose arms show the imprint of patterns that may have been stamped, tattooed, or scarified on an actual person.\n1.

The  commemorated ancestor sits on an ornate chair, wearing a stovepipe hat and clothes, while protected from the elements by a figure holding an umbrella. All of these status symbols indicate the wealth and standing of the deceased. The Christian cross, also seen on (2), indicates a familiarity with Portuguese Catholicism, but the cross is also a symbol of Mawu, the female half of the Fon creator couple and an apotropaic symbol. The chameleon holding the cutlass atop the tree represents Lisa, the male half of the creator couple. He signifies transformation.

As in (1) the honored person is surrounded by symbols that refer to Fon proverbs. The bird on a stalk of millet prompts the saying: ¿If only one bird remains, he will find a field of millet and eat,¿ suggesting that even if only one child remains, he or she will do everything necessary to properly honor a dead parent. Another element of this tableau is the kpanzon, a wooden column with a bifurcated capital that acts as a guardian spirit for a household.\n\nThe tableau of (2) shows a kneeling figure holding and offering a calabash vessel to two seated figures.

The offering of the calabash is also a metaphor for the connection between the living and the dead; ancestors too drink from the calabash offered by the living.

Carved female and male caryatid figures uphold the ceiling of a verandah or flank doorways. Such a column can be a simple one with a few figures, or an elaborate one with many. The characters probably represent royal guardians or retainers (political allies of the king) who ensure the fertility and welfare of the kingdom.  The elongated form, restrained gesture and large eyes of this figure exhibit the stylistic features of Grassfield architectural sculpture.   Bibliography:  1. Gebauer, P.

Spiny oyster shells were highly valued for their bright orange-red lining, as well as for their ability to induce visions when eaten sparingly during red tides.\n1.

The text accompanying the illustration describes ¿the scene by the sea-side-the dolce far niente-the hunt for crustacea-the hour spent in sketching the distant schooner-the delightful tetes-a-tetes-are they not all written in our memories?¿  This pastiche is well-fitted to the miscellaneous incidents collected in Homer's picture.\n\nWinslow Homer in Print intro text:\nWINSLOW HOMER IN PRINT\n\nWinslow Homer (1836-1910), one of the greatest of America's nineteenth-century artists, launched his career in 1857 as a freelance illustrator for popular magazines.  For the most part Homer's illustrations featured imagery with a broad appeal for the audiences of  such publications as Harper's Weekly.  Close examination of the illustrations, however,  reveals the lines of development in his art as a whole.  In the years before the Civil War Homer portrayed scenes crowded with figures and anecdotal details.  His work as a correspondent at the front during the war brought a change not only in subject matter, but also in style.  Scenes of the war came to be more sharply focused, with incidental details trimmed away to give a more dramatic effect.  \nIn the years following the war this clarity was carried over to new subjects.  The simplified, yet sophisticated compositions lent charm and elegance to Homer's depiction of people, particularly women and children, engaged in leisure pursuits in the countryside and at the seashore.   The perils of the sea and the human struggle for survival-subjects which foreshadow Homer's later, greatest paintings-began to appear in the illustrations of the 1870s.  In these years the artist began to concentrate on painting in watercolor and in oil, reworking the motifs of the paintings in his magazine illustrations in order to make his more serious work known to a wider audience.  Finally, in 1875 Homer abandoned the field of illustration altogether to support himself solely by his painting.  \nWood engraving was the predominant method of mass production of images for illustration for magazines in the nineteenth century before the advent of photographic processes in the 1880s.  Artists like Homer executed their designs directly onto a wood block which had been polished and coated with white.  The block was then given to an engraver employed by the publisher, who carved away the bare white parts of the surface with a graver, a small sharpened steel rod.  Cutting across the end grain of the wood made possible finely detailed lines.  The lines drawn by the artist were left in relief, to be printed like type.  The blocks were then inked and sent through the press to create multiple copies of the original design.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Subjectivity bias and jargon bias, Subjectie labels: greatest.
