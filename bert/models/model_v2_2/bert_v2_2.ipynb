The most celebrated artistic expression of arete was the image of the Diadoumenos, the victorious athlete binding a victory ribbon around his head (see head displayed to the right of this case). As founder of the Olympic games, slayer of monsters, and master of seemingly impossible labors, the foremost Greek hero and athlete, Herakles, embodied the very concept of arete. They are accompanied by an Olympian escort: armed Athena, Dionysos with grape vines and a large drinking cup, and Hermes with his traveling garb and winged staff entwined by snakes. Because of the assistance he gave the gods, Herakles was invited to join them; this scene may show his introduction to their home on Mount Olympos. For mortals, the best opportunity to display arete in peacetime came at  the Panhellenic festival games.

The most famous were the crown, or stephanitic, games held at the sanctuaries of Olympia, Delphi, Isthmia, and Nemea at which the victor won only a wreath. Of these, those held during the Panathenaic festival in Athens were most important. A gold olive wreath (4) was the prize won there for the musical contest among kitharodes, men who sang while accompanying themselves on the kithara, a large stringed instrument, similar to a lyre. The diskos (discus) throw was one of the five events of the ancient Greek pentathlon. The image of the diskobolos, or diskos thrower, greatly appealed to Greek artists, who were fascinated by the image of the nude male youth on the threshold of adulthood, the embodiment of physical excellence. In the center, a woman, probably his wife, sits in attendance on a stool, while a naked serving boy draws wine from a large vessel. Engraved inside the rim is an inscription in Carian, an as yet poorly understood language of the peoples living in southwest Asia Minor. While several cities held games, the most famous were the crown, or stephanitic, games held at the sanctuaries of Olympia, Delphi, Isthmia, and Nemea. Of the chrematitic games (where prizes of value were awarded) those held during the Panathenaic festival in Athens were most important. Combined, these qualities composed the innate excellence which enabled him to rid the world of the monsters and noxious creatures that terrorized lesser men. Theseus, too, performed a series of nearly impossible tasks that allowed him to demonstrate his arete.

(Our word \"\"cocoa\"\" comes from the Spanish \"\"cacao,\"\" a direct transcription of the Maya \"\"kakaw.\"\")  Its extremely fine painting and the addition of hieroglyphs around the rim show it originally belonged a very elite owner.  Experts feel this piece was created around A.D. 650 in what is now northern Guatemala. They disagree, however, on the interpretation of the imagery and the writing, as these complex aspects of Maya art are still in the process of decipherment.     What appears to be represented in this painting in the round is a struggle amongst three figures in the Underworld, the dark, watery way-station between life and death.  The standing figure wields a spear to attack a masked man emerging from the gaping maw of a serpent.  A seated god, identified by his square eye, assists the spear-bearer by preparing to chop the serpent\\'s tail with his axe.  Although some traditional Maya stories are preserved in a sixteenth-century book, the Popol Vuh, this particular scene does not appear.  Therefore, its interpretation continues to elude us.     Yet the artistic mastery of Maya vase painting, paralleling that of the ancient Greeks, is anything but elusive.  As if in a dance rather than a fight, graceful gestures are captured with sweeping calligraphic flourish.  This typical lyricism may blind modern audiences to the pervasive theme of domination that permeates Maya art; aesthetics were often used in the service of the political rivalry characteristic of city-states.  Perhaps by commissioning such a mythic battle scene this vessel\\'s owner portrayed himself as victorious over his enemies.  \" Experts feel.

According to the text, these Igbo figures, known as Alusi, represent ancestral deities and are kept in well-tended, embellished shrines.  Alusi are removed from their shrines, dressed and sometimes painted for annual harvest festivals.    The Igbo also defer to these sculptures for judgement in their administrative affairs.  The oracle will pronounce judgement and strike the wrongdoer ill.  Certain Alusi are well-known for their efficacy in settling disputes.  People will travel from all over to present their cases before them.  The stance and proportions of these figures, male and female, are typical of the northeast Igbo region where the posture and traits are stylized.

The facial features are quite different.     Fagg, William. African Tribal Images: The Katherine White Reswick Collection. Cleveland: The Cleveland Museum of Art, 1968.   Similar crest appears on an Ibibio female figure (Figure 162).  According to Fagg, this figure is suggestive of the Ogbom headdress figures which the Ibo of Bende adopted and imitated.  The figure style, however, does not resemble the Arnett piece.   Jones, G. I. The Art of Eastern Nigeria. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1984.

The often remarkable state of preservation of furniture, mats, baskets, platters of food, boxes, and jewelry reveal that tombs were literally houses for the dead, stocked with personal possessions and all the provisions necessary in an afterlife. The diverse objects deposited in tombs often provide our only record of how people lived. They also offer clues to the origins of different populations.

Each population and period can be identified by distinctive characteristics reflected by the objects used in everyday life. Artifacts reveal methods of manufacture and the state of technology, the preferences for certain materials, either locally obtained or imported, and the indigenous or foreign influences on artistic traditions and styles. STONEWORKING (1-3)   The production of stone tools, weapons, and vessels was the premier craft industry from the Neolithic period into the Early Bronze Age. Although no artifacts here illustrate the industry in its early manifestations, alabaster vessels are an example of Middle Bronze Age stoneworking (1-3). These vessels were first produced in Egypt as small containers for ointments, precious perfumes, and aromatic oils and were imported to the Levant as well as locally produced. At Jericho, craftsmen used a local alabaster, known as gypsum or calcium sulphate, which was probably obtained from Beisan, 70 kilometers from the site. The softness of alabaster made it easy to work. A block of stone was cut into a cylindrical shape and hollowed out with a metal chisel or drill. In some cases, the vessels were made in several pieces, with the rim and the neck worked separately and then inserted into the body. Finally, the surface was polished with a finely ground sandstone such as sandquartz. WOODWORKING (4-6)  At Jericho, Middle Bronze Age tombs are the sole source for our knowledge of wooden artifacts, including boxes (4), vessels (6), and furniture (5). The partial survival of furniture was especially remarkable, since they present a picture of what the furnished houses of Jericho might have looked like. Tables were long and narrow, consisting of a single plank attached by tenon and mortise joints to three legs, a feature which made the tables more stable on uneven earth-covered floors. Stools were of two sizes, seating either one or two persons. The legs and seat-rails were made from wood, while the seats were made of rushes, suggested by the holes bored in the seat-rails. Decoration was limited to the legs of furniture, which were often carved in a curved geometric form, loosely derived from Egyptian style furniture. Other wooden items used in households included vessels (6) and wooden boxes (4), often decorated with incised bone inlay. Craftsmen used local timbers such as tamarisk and willow to fashion small wooden items, while stronger, higher quality timber, such as imported cedar, was utilized for larger furniture. Though very few tools have survived, it is presumed that copper and, more rarely, bronze axes, adzes, and saws would have been employed for hewing, trimming timber, and cutting planks, while chisels, bow drills, and awls would have been used to carve and cut mortises, tenons, and bore holes. SPINNING AND WEAVING (7-12) Evidence for the textile industry in ancient Jericho is recorded by badly preserved textile fragments and various tools and accessories which have survived. It is presumed that, at various times, the people of Jericho used plant fibers from palm trees, flax, and possibly animal hair fibers to weave and sew clothing. Draped robes and kilts made of a plain weave were attached by toggle pins (12) and worn along with rarer tunics that were cut and sewn into shape. Analogies with the textile industry in Egypt suggest that the process of making textiles at Jericho probably consisted of three steps. Fibers were prepared by being soaked, beaten, and combed out or hackled. The fibers were then ready for spinning where they were then drawn on a spindle and twisted to produce yarn. As early as the Pottery Neolithic Period at Jericho (ca. 5500-4000 B.C.), wooden spindles weighted with a whorl made of wood or stone (8-10) were commonly used. After spinning, the yarn was warped on the loom. Because very few loom weights (7) have been found in the Bronze Age levels (1800-1550 B.C.), it is possible that a horizontal loom was used. Little is known about the tools involved in the weaving process at Jericho except that they were used in other industries. Awls (11), for example, were likely to have been used to press  down the weft in the course of the weaving when no comb was available, or to pick up the threads of the weft to make designs. POTTERY PRODUCTION (13-19)  Pottery, more so than any other craft, shows the growing sophistication in technique displayed by Jericho's changing potters. Pottery first appeared at Jericho in the Neolithic Period along with the arrival of newcomers during the sixth millennium B.C.  These early potters produced simple handmade vessels, such as bowls, juglets, and lamps (13, 14). During the Early Bronze Age, potters introduced the innovation of a slow wheel, which was used to make the necks and rims of vessels that attached onto handmade bodies (15). Vessels made entirely on a faster potter's wheel (16, 17) were produced during the later Middle Bronze Age. In addition to the potter's wheel, various containers and tools were used by the potter. Jars served as containers for water, slip, wash, and paint. Mortars (20) and pestles (19) were probably used to grind temper for clay or colored minerals and pigments for decoration. Once formed, the pot may have been burnished by rubbing shells or smooth stones (18) across the surface. In Jericho, no workshops or kilns were found, but evidence from elsewhere in the Levant suggests that pottery was fired in open fire pits or in permanent kilns located on the outskirts of the city. 1, 2.

Permanent collection gallery: Bats and Armadillos The rich, tropical environment of Costa Rica supports the largest number of species on the planet, including the bat  (1-4) and the armadillo (5-7). Bats, nocturnal hunters, use their special \"sight\" to navigate. The analogy between the bat and the shaman is strong, as shamanic rituals take place at night and feature visions. The flute (3) captures a pose that may mimic the blowing of the flute itself, another covert reference to human transformation into animal counterparts. Armadillos also seem to have \"magical\" abilities, like being able to walk underwater on streambeds. Costa Ricans, like other ancient American shamanic peoples, truly appreciated the miraculous in nature. 1.                  Ceremonial Bat Mace Head.

MCCM Permanent Collection Gallery, 2013: The Economy in Mesopotamia One of Mesopotamia’s most important inventions and contributions to the ancient Near East was cuneiform (\"wedge-shaped\") writing. In use for more than 3,000 years (ca. 3100 BC–AD 75), cuneiform script was adapted for writing many languages and used to record\\u2028inventories and business transactions, legal codes, and literary, commemorative, and dedicatory texts. Economic texts were extremely numerous, listing goods traded, wages paid, and rations distributed. These were measured in the ancient Mesopotamian units of ga, gu, or sa. In order for the documents not to be tampered with, important texts were wrapped in a clay envelope on which the text was recorded again and a seal applied. The Mesopotamians used sets of standard weights in conducting business. The weights themselves were usually made of a very hard stone like hematite. A simple barrel shape was the most common form, but weights in the form of ducks and other animals were also common. High quality, workable stone was a rare commodity in Mesopotamia, and therefore, the majority of the stones used to manufacture vessels, cylinder seals, and weights had to be imported. Stone vessels were highly prized and were often used as dedications to temples or deposited as grave offerings. 1. Sickle. Mesopotamia, Ur. Ubaid, 4000–3500 BC. Clay. 1921.150, 153. 2.

Rosen Permanent collection gallery: THE ECONOMY IN MESOPOTAMIA One of Mesopotamia\\'s most important inventions and contributions to the ancient Near East was cuneiform (¿wedge-shaped¿) writing. In use for more than 3000 years (ca. 3100 bc-ad 75), cuneiform script was adapted for writing many languages and used to record inventories and business transactions, legal codes, and literary, commemorative, and dedicatory texts. Economic texts were extremely numerous, describing goods being traded, wages paid, and rations distributed. These were measured in the ancient Mesopotamian units of ga, gu, or sa. In order for the documents not to be tampered with, important texts were wrapped in a clay envelope on which the text was recorded again and a seal applied. The Mesopotamians used sets of standard weights in conducting business. The weights themselves were usually made of a very hard stone like hematite. A simple barrel shape was the most common form, but weights in the form of ducks and other animals were also common. High quality, workable stone was a rare commodity in Mesopotamia, and therefore, the majority of the stones used to manufacture vessels, cylinder seals, and weights had to be imported. Stone vessels were valued and highly prized and were often used as dedications to temples or deposited as grave offerings. 1. Sickle. Mesopotamia, Ur. Ubaid, 4000-3500 BC. Clay. 1921.150, 153. 2.

Cuneiform (¿wedge-shaped¿) writing was one of Mesopotamia\\'s most important inventions and contributions to the ancient Near East. In use for over 3000 years (ca. 3100 BC-ad 75), cuneiform script was adapted for writing many languages and used to record inventories and business transactions, legal codes, and literary, commemorative and dedicatory texts. 1-6. Many bricks (1-3) were stamped or inscribed with commemorative inscriptions bearing the name of the king. Clay tablets in the form of cylinders or cones (4-6) also bore commemorative building inscriptions and recorded the name of the builder, usually a king, and often lengthy recitals of historical and cultic events. These were placed by the hundreds in the walls and foundations of temples and palaces. 7-9. Letters of important texts were wrapped in a clay envelope, on which the text was re-recorded and a seal applied (7). This precaution prevented anyone from tampering with the message by rewetting the clay and changing the inscription. A similar precaution was used for all kinds of containers, sealed with a clay ball, on which the owner\\'s seal was rolled (8,9) 10-25. All kinds of state employees were listed on clay tablets, with their wages, tasks, and rations measured in units of ga, gu, or sa (10-15). Clay tablets recorded various aspects of agriculture including the sowing and the distribution of cultivated grains, or the collection of reeds (16-18). The coming and going of livestock, particularly those destined to be sacrificed or offered for religious purposes, were recorded as well (19-25). 27.  Scribes had to undergo extensive training in order to master cuneiform writing. Trainee scribes first learned how to make tablets from clay and practiced writing cuneiform signs by copying short texts.

For about a hundred years, Egypt was divided between the 17th Dynasty in the south and Canaanite rulers called the Hyksos in the north. In about 1550 B.C., the Theban king Ahmose ascended the throne and during his reign drove out the Hyksos, becoming the founder of the 18th Dynasty. Subsequent kings continued to carry out military campaigns and established an empire in Syria-Palestine to the northeast and in Nubia to the south. Outstanding rulers of the 18th Dynasty include Hatshepsut, one of the few women in Egyptian history to take the titles of king (2, 4, 5); her coregent and nephew Thutmose III, who secured and enlarged the empire; his great-grandson Amenhotep III who presided over a luxurious court during a period of peace; his heretic son Akhenaten who established a new religion and art style (7) and was succeeded by the famous boy king Tutankhamun. In the 19th and 20th Dynasties, the best-known rulers are Ramses II (1) and Ramses III. The first is renowned for the great rock-cut temple of Abu Simbel in Nubia and for his battle against the Hittites at Qadesh in north Syria. The second saved Egypt from the so-called Sea Peoples who tried to invade the Delta by land and sea. Votive stelae (1) were set up in temples to enable the owner to participate for eternity in the cult of the deity worshiped there. Here, the owner adores a statue called Usermaatra Montuemtawy, a divine form of Ramesses II. 1. Fragment of Votive Stela Dedicated by the Scribe Paenmehit.

L1993.5.9 Permanent collection galleries: THE NEW KINGDOM (18TH-20TH DYNASTIES, CA. 1550-1070 B.C.) For about a hundred years, Egypt was divided between the 17th Dynasty in the south and Canaanite rulers called the Hyksos in the north. In about 1550 B.C., the Theban king Ahmose ascended the throne and during his reign drove out the Hyksos, becoming the founder of the 18th Dynasty. Subsequent kings continued to carry out military campaigns and established an empire in Syria-Palestine to the northeast and in Nubia to the south. Outstanding rulers of the 18th Dynasty include Hatshepsut, one of the few women in Egyptian history to take the titles of king (2, 4, 5); her coregent and nephew Thutmose III, who secured and enlarged the empire; his great-grandson Amenhotep III who presided over a luxurious court during a period of peace; his heretic son Akhenaten who established a new religion and art style (7) and was succeeded by the famous boy king Tutankhamun. In the 19th and 20th Dynasties, the best-known rulers are Ramses II (1) and Ramses III. The first is renowned for the great rock-cut temple of Abu Simbel in Nubia and for his battle against the Hittites at Qadesh in north Syria. The second saved Egypt from the so-called Sea Peoples who tried to invade the Delta by land and sea. Votive stelae (1) were set up in temples to enable the owner to participate for eternity in the cult of the deity worshiped there. Here, the owner adores a statue called Usermaatra Montuemtawy, a divine form of Ramesses II. 1. Fragment of Votive Stela Dedicated by the Scribe Paenmehit.

Animals sacred to a deity were bred, mummified, and buried in vast cemeteries. Individuals could present such an animal as a votive offering, alone or encased in a pot or a tiny coffin of wood or bronze surmounted by a figure of the animal. In some instances, the coffin itself was in the shape of the animal. Animal cults were dedicated to a single creature viewed as the physical embodiment of a deity, of which the best-known example is that of the Apis bull.

Animals sacred to certain deities were bred, sacrificed, mummified, and buried in huge necropoleis within the temple precincts. The cult of the Apis bull was one of the oldest animal cults and ultimately, the most renowned. Unlike other cults that might sacrifice thousands of animals, that of the Apis bull centered around a single, chosen animal. A fertility god called Apis was venerated as early as the First Dynasty, although the deity ultimately merged with Ptah, a creator-god. The Apis bull was considered the physical manifestation of Ptah, containing the ba, or essence, of the deity. Worshipped in the cult center of Ptah at Memphis, the Apis was treated to a coronation ceremony and a luxurious lifestyle in a sacred precinct. Each bull was selected after an exhaustive search throughout Egypt. According to Herodotus, the fifth-century BC Greek historian, the Apis bull \"is the calf of a cow which is never afterwards able to have another...a flash of light descends upon the cow from heaven, and this causes her to receive Apis.  The Apis-calf has distinctive marks: it is black, with a white diamond on its forehead, the image of an eagle on its back, the hairs on its tail double, and a scarab under its tongue\" (Book 3, ch. 29). The death of the Apis bull was accompanied by even greater ceremony than its installation. Beginning in the reign of Amenhotep III, the bull was mummified just as a human would have been and entombed in an enormous sarcophagus in a necropolis known as the Serapeum. Located at Saqqara, the Serapeum was actively used for Apis burials from the New Kingdom until the Ptolemaic Period. Just as with a human burial, the Apis was provided with extensive funerary equipment, including Canopic jars and shabtis, both of which were typically bull-headed. The Apis bull and the Serapeum were the focus of intense public piety beginning in the Late Period. Within the subterranean chambers and corridors of the Serapeum, hundreds of visitors dedicated stelae and votive images of the bull as signs of their devotion. Small, bronze figures were particularly popular, often depicting the donor kneeling before the Apis, or simply the bull with an inscription. Stelae of all sizes and levels of quality were inserted in the walls throughout the Serapeum, typically portraying the dedicant paying homage to Apis. In this instance, several donors appear before the crowned bull, including both men and women, probably members of the same family. Upon its death, the Apis bull as identified with Osiris in a syncretized form known as Osiris-Apis or Osorapis. Ptolemy I Soter (ca. 305-285 BC) introduced a cult specifically devoted to this deity in a Hellenized form as Serapis. The cult of Serapis, in conjunction with that of Isis, the wife of Osiris manifest in the mother of the Apis bull, was whole-heartedly embraced by the Graeco-Roman world, spreading to its farthest boundaries. The Apis bull represented on of the most enduring aspects of Egyptian religion and culture, venerated until the destruction of the Serapeum in the fourth century AD, when the Emperor Honorius banned the use of pagan sanctuaries.

Permanent collection galleries 133A: UNDERWATER ARCHAEOLOGY While the prospect of discovering submerged cities and sunken treasures has sparked the imagination of many through the ages, it was only in the last decades of the twentieth century that the systematic exploration of the depths of oceans and lakes became feasible. Revolutionary diving equipment, developed by innovators like the French oceanographer Jacques Cousteau and the American industrialist and aviation engineer Edwin A. Link, made the methodical exploration of underwater sites possible. Sophisticated new equipment has recently proven that navigation in antiquity was not limited to coastal sailing as was previously believed, but that high seas crossings were also undertaken. Locating, mapping, excavating, conserving, and reconstructing maritime sites and their artifacts have made an invaluable contribution to our knowledge of economics and everyday life in antiquity. While Phoenicians and Greeks were recognized as the most successful early merchants and navigators, the Romans, through their vast territorial conquests, greatly extended the range of trade and degree of interconnection between peoples.

According to Lori\\'s memo, the designation of Etowah as provenance and Phillips Academy as source on the accession worksheets seemed arbitrary and not based on prior museum records.

Permanent collection gallery: A Panamanian Grave The typical Panamanian grave, such as those at the cemetery of Sitio Conte, contained any number of smashed ceramics (5). The \"ritual killing\" of objects characterized almost all ancient American cultures. Purposeful defacing, breaking, or violent altering of artwork may have either been a politically motivated power statement or represented the desire to take prestige items out of economic circulation. Mutilation may also indicate the spiritual belief that all things have a life force that must be modified when the object goes into the Underworld. If plates were considered alive, they apparently had to be killed to properly accompany the deceased in the burial. In order to honor the ancient practices, a poorly restored pedestal plate was returned to the fragmentary state it had taken on in the grave (5). Before being smashed, it looked more like objects 1 and 6. Inversion (1) was another unusual way of treating pedestal plates in the Sitio Conte burials. Some of the many offerings were placed upright, but others were turned upside down to feature the underside. This inverted pedestal plate shows the care with which the underside was often painted. Ancient American artists paid attention to all sides of works of art out of respect for an object\\'s essential completeness, an important part of its being considered alive. This inverted burial position also served to give the Underworld, the mirror of the terrestrial world, its own perspective on the imagery. Other typical Panamanian grave goods included hand axes (2, 3), spear points (4), and plain ceramics (6). Panamanian hand axes were made from hard, practical stones and were usually broken from heavy use, showing that their actual function as land-clearing tools was paramount in their meaning when placed in the grave. Evidently they symbolized the agricultural prowess of the deceased and the belief that provisioning was to be continued in the afterlife. By contrast, the spear points were chipped from chert and jasper and may have been ceremonial, given their tiny size and striking colors of orange, green, and purple. The colors favored for the points are those found in ceramic slips, especially the orange and the purple. (Purple, seen in 1, is one of the most unusual slip colors known and, in the Americas, was developed only here and in the Andean Nasca culture.) Scattering multicolored points added another visually fragmented element in the burial. 1. Inverted Pedestal Plate with Underside Checkerboard Designs. Central     America, Panamá, Macaracas.

The Near East During the Neolithic Period (ca 8500-4300 BC)  During the 4000 years of the Neolithic period, people in the Near East introduced changes that had far-reaching consequences for the development of civilization. Several areas of the Near East offered ideal conditions for the introduction of agriculture: a mild climate, the existence of several species of wild grains which flourished on the mountain slopes, and a water supply which could be dammed or drained from streams or marshes. The important developments of the Neolithic period are well represented by the early settlements at Jericho in the Levant, Catal Huyuk in Anatolia, and Tell es Sawwan in northern Mesopotamia. Each site displays a rich and complex culture with distinctive art, architecture, craft traditions, and burial customs that reflect individual environments, economies, and religions. Jericho (1-12) Ancient Jericho  (Tell es-Sultan) is one of the key sites of the period with and impressive Neolithic settlement. Tools and weapons used for agriculture and hunting purposes were made primarily from stone and included sickle blades, knives, scrapers, and arrowheads. Stone grinders, querns, and pestles (2-8) were used to prepare flour and a variety of stone and bone tools, polishing stones (9,10), awls (11), borers and scrapers were utilized for sewing, weaving, leatherworking, basketry and other crafts. Stone grinders, querns, and pestles (2-8) were used to prepare flour and a variety of stone and bone tools, polishing stones (9,10), awls (11), borers and scrapers were utilized for sewing, weaving, leatherworking, basketry and other crafts. Catal Huyuk (12-20)  Catal Huyuk, occupied after 6000 BC, was one of the largest, more densely built, and prosperous Neolithic settlements in Anatolia. A number of human figurines found at the site (17, 18) suggest that a female fertility figure was a prominent deity. Tell es Sawwan (21-28)  Tell es Sawwan was a sophisticated Neolithic settlement near the Tigris River in northern Mesopotamia during the sixth through fifth millennia BC.

When the Egyptians realized this, they began a search for an artificial way to keep the body intact that led to the invention of mummification.

The note has a handwritten note: \"from a 1988 butterfield photo auction -  silver prints made in the 1930\\'s from 19th Century negatives\". On the note is also the address of Edgar Bissantz with a handwritten note: \"maybe the original owner?\". The documents were found in an unrelated acquisition file of Zewadski.

The Maya-related pot here (4) displays just such a killhole in its base.  Scholars believe such treatment signifies that art was considered to hold life force which needed to be dispersed by compromising its wholeness.  In this way, the art assumed the proper state to travel the Underworld with its owner. Other significant holes were made in the human body, apparently in order to increase social status.

New working title from Gyatso\\'s representative: \"Family Album\" There will be around 20 large scale photos and 10 free standing components. Exact numbers, dimensions, and images of works will be available mid-June. The artwork is now a collaboration between Gyatso and Chinese fashion photographer, Yin Chao. Artist\\'s statement on the exhibition (as of 4/26/2016): Tibetan identity is a complex melange that is informed by a globalizing world and at the same time is rooted in a deep pride for cultural heritage. The ingredients of Tibetan life are found through the portrayal of one family living in Lhasa. In this one family there are Communist Party members, bankers, soccer players, artists, teachers, foreigners, government workers, farmers and nuns, infants, students, mom\\'s, dad\\'s, step parents, brother and sisters and grandparents. The photographs explore the complex, dynamic aspects of contemporary life in Tibet through the lens of a \"Family Album\". However, this is a contemporary photo album, edited, cropped, airbrushed and fit for portrayal on social media platforms. Gonkar and photographer, Yin Chao employ the device of fashion and pop culture of China and the West. In doing so Gonkar (and Yin Chao) hope to challenge stereotypes of what it means to be \"Tibetan\" and at the same time explore how this packaging of ourselves affects our own concept of \"self\". As in his \"My Identity\" series Gonkar explores the fundamental aspects of identity. He continues to ask, who are we? How did we get here? and Where are we going? Gonkar now plans to use both galleries 318 and 314. He may also want to keep the sand mandala in place. Matting and photos is still a question. Gonkar will be onsite 9 days for the installation and 9 days for his residency. Joe requests that install be completed on 8/31 in time for a members\\' opening on 9/1, which Gonkar will attend. Exhibition consists of the following: 10+ large format photo prints based upon Gyatso’s My Identity series ( http://www.oneart.org/galleries/gonkar-gyatso-my-identity ); A large scale installation sculpture in the form of eight objects sitting in decorated baby swings to symbolize the reincarnation.

On March 13, 2019, water was discovered in several cases in the Americas galleries, including 106B, where textiles were installed. Though water came into the case, the installed textiles remained dry. The textiles from 106B (2002.001.014 and 2003.040.011) were deinstalled, as were the textiles in 106D (2002.001.011 and 2002.001.029). The other textiles in the rotation remained in their cases. The deinstalled textiles were reinstalled in their cases in late June 2019. Orginal deinstallation date for this rotation was February 4, 2019. With the retirement of Rebecca Stone in the spring of 2018, new curator Megan O'Neil was hired. Megan O'Neil was on sabbatical spring semester, but wanted to be involved in the installation of the textile rotations. In consultation with Renee Stein and Patricia Ewer, it was decided that textile rotation 12 could remain installed until the fall of 2019. A tentative installation date of September 9, 2019 has been proposed for rotation 13. Originally planned to be installed July 9, 2018.

In June 2016 curator Rebecca Stone suggested textile rotations up through the summer of 2021, planning for rotations past her retirement in spring 2018. The last rotation completed with Dr. Stone\\'s plans was Rotation 12, which was installed in the summer of 2018 and remained installed until March 2020 (see exhbition record for Rotation 12 for explanation of the length of rotation). Dr. Stone\\'s plans for Rotations 13-18 did not include any ancient textiles. Dr. Stone intended to include facsimile drawings from Nueva Corónica y Buen Gobierno by Guaman Poma in the cases that had previously had ancient textile rotations. The notes from Dr. Stone\\'s rotation plans stated that Laura Wingfield should choose the Guatemalan textiles for Rotations 13-18. Laura Wingfield left the Carlos Museum in late 2016. The only textiles ever designated for these rotation were molas. Megan O\\'Neil was hired as curator after Rebecca Stone\\'s retirement. Dr. O\\'Neil implemented her own versions of rotations. As Dr. Stone\\'s Rotations 13-18 were never implemented, the information from those exhibition records was consolidated into this one record (SUGGESTED AA Textile Rotations 13-18 (Winter 2019-Summer 2021)), and the individual rotation records were deleted. In Dr. O\\'Neil\\'s discussions with conservators, preparators and registrars it was decided to rotate organics once a year, in March. These rotations would include not only textiles, but the organics in the Native North American galleries as well. As such, the exhibition records for Americas rotations from March 2020 forward are titled \"Americas Organics Rotations\" and start over at number 1. Notes from original exhibition record for Textile Rotation 18 (Summer 2021): The current selection of Guatemalan textiles in case 111G will be reversed for this Rotation.

Research and Bibliography: \" Research:  In some of the kingdoms in the Grassfields of western Cameroon, a  commemorative statue of a fon (king) is carved during his reign. The representation is used on ceremonial occasions during the fon\\'s absence, and serves as a genealogical reference after his death. This figure sits on a prestige stool in a relaxed pose. He wears a chief\\'s cap and carries a drinking horn. The stool has an abstract representation of the spider motif, a symbol of wisdom. Although the carving shows a tendency toward naturalism, the face of the ruler is a generic rendering. With its almond-shaped eyes, projecting ears, and an expression resembling a smile, it is reminiscent of Grassfield masks. Bibliography:  1. Gebauer, P.

A February 14, 1997 file memo from registrar Lori Iliff discussed how sources and provenance were determined for objects that were believed to have an Etowah or Etowah-related provenance. This memo did not discuss the X.0600-X.0697 numbered objects, as the sources and provenance of those objects had been discussed in a March 1990 memo. Information regarding the objects in the 1997 memo came from the Accession Log I (green-blue colored ledger) and old accession sheets. According to Lori\\'s memo it was unclear when the accession log was started, but was on or prior to 1984. The accession worksheets had been created in 1984. According to Lori\\'s memo, the designation of Etowah as provenance and Phillips Academy as source on the accession worksheets seemed arbitrary and not based on prior museum records. Therefore the designation of Etowah or Phillips Academy based solely on an accession worksheet may be suspect. Below is a summary of what was found for this object. X.0232.011 - According to the memo, the accession log lists no source, but lists Etowah as provenance. The memo does not mention an accession worksheet. However, there is a 1984 accession worksheet in the object file. This worksheet lists the provenance as \"Georgia, Etowah Mounds, Tumin Village Site\", though someone bracketed that information and wrote \"N/A\" next to it. No source is noted. The memos from the 1990s do not mention the \"Specimen Record\" worksheets housed in the blue fabric-covered binders. A few of these worksheets contain notes added by Lori Iliff in 1994. It is unclear why these worksheets are not mentioned in the 1990s memos, but for completeness, their information is noted here. It is however, unclear when these worksheets were created, by whom, and where the information in the worksheets came from. Many have notes regarding packing objects for storage in 1982, so it can be assumed these were created in 1982 or earlier. The specimen record for X.0232.011 does not note provenance or source.

MHDST2. 2013 Reinstallation label: Maya Polychrome Ceramics During their height between 600 and 900 AD, the Maya created bowls (1, 2), tall beakers (3–5) and effigy flutes (6) painted with buff, orange, and black slip. Some were incised through the buff slip to the orange clay below, like 2, though most were painted (1, 3–5). The high degree of sophistication and artistic exploration characteristic of Late Classic Maya culture is clear when looking closely at the ceramic arts. Class consciousness can also be discerned in vessels that imitate high status examples (3). The subjects may be expressively human, such as a gentle and genteel Maya mother with a child on her back (6, the baby’s head has broken off). They may relate to rulers, adding a profile face found on royal headdresses and scepters (5) to a container for drinking the high-status chocolate beverage kakaw. Further up the scale, some vessels concern deities: 2 represents the snakefooted god K’awil, patron of divination and rulership. Highly esoteric images include disembodied eyeballs interspersed with jaguar spots (4), perhaps a reference to the addition of entheogens to the kakaw and the dizzying visions of becoming a jaguar that result. Some pieces speak to issues we may not associate with preindustrial societies, including “art for art’s sake.” While most Maya ceramics depict recognizable imagery, 1’s subject is limited to the brushstroke itself, seemingly an instance of art about art. The elevated social status of the artist, usually just below royalty, apparently meant that at times aesthetics could be self-referential. The social status hierarchy is also apparent in 3: while many chocolate vessels have hieroglyphs painted around the rim identifying the scene and/or the pot’s owner, here the generalized shapes in this position are actually only pretend writing. These “pseudo-glyphs” indicate that the owner had an artist, who presumably could not read glyphs either, come up with gibberish to impress others. A highly elaborated culture generates fine social distinctions, and rule breaking as well as following them. 1. Bowl with Abstract Brushstroke Design Mesoamerica, Peten, Guatemala, Maya.

However, this vessel is trying to give the appearance of elite status without exhibiting elite quality. The walls of the vessel are thick, the painting is somewhat sloppy, and the designs around the rim, meant to be glyphic text, are undecipherable. Such imitations of text are referred to as pseudoglyphs, and underscore the pedestrian nature of this vessel. The ¿Serpent Eye¿ motif also diverges from elite versions of the design, implying that both artist and patron were unaware of the complexities of Maya writing and iconography.

Permanent collection gallery: Late Classic Maya Ceramics Maya Cylinder Vessels (3, 5-7, 9, 10) were actually used to contain chocolate drinks (in Mayan languages kakaw [kah-kow], from which our word \"cocoa\" originates). Bowls (1, 4, 8, 11, 12) held the staple maize cereals and gruels; in fact, scientific tests of residue left in 11 revealed maize. By contrast, some vessels were intentionally rendered unusable: some flat plates (2) were \"killed\" by drilling a hole in their center. Such  vessels placed upside down over the face of the deceased were believed to allow the soul to exit the body. Most Maya ceramics were painted, but a few were incised (7, 11, 12). A band of carved glyphs (7), painted glyphs (5, 10), or, interestingly, painted imitations of glyphs (6) is often found around the rim. Pretend writing can be seen as a form of social climbing: in a society with a low literacy rate the appearance of readable glyphs added some prestige to a \"middle-class\" pot. The currently untranslatable glyphs in 10 read \"hok\" and \"bok.\" Of the over thirty Maya languages, not all have been deciphered yet. Painted designs range from simple brushstrokes (1) to patterns of shells (8), from monstrous supernatural heads (5) to abstract symbols that combine animal characteristics (6), from Underworld scenes (10) to signs for ? day? (3), and from the calendrical date \"7 Ahau\" (4) to extruded eyeballs (9). The most complex scene (10) depicts a struggle between a snake, a seated god about to stab the snake with his bloody axe, and a spear-bearer (not visible here, as extensive modern overpainting was removed from his torso). This piece epitomizes the complexity, elegance, and subtlety of the Maya artistic vision. 1.  Bowl with Abstract Brushstroke Design. Mesoamerica, Guatemala, Peten, Maya.

Unusual here is the depiction of a male and female figure rather than the more common female pair. It is possible that these figures were carved to represent twins, which, like the king or queen who used the stool in public ceremonies, embody a special connection to the ancestors.

Due to internal miscommunications at MCCM, the Registrar\\'s office believed for the run of Through a Glass Darkly that the Pitts Theology Library\\'s copy of Pietrasanta\\'s \"De symbolis herocis\" was in the exhibition (L2019.005.002). The Pitts loan number appeared on the label, though the label credit line said Rose Library. The Pitts copy is credited in the Through a Glass Darkly catalog. In fact, the Pitts copy had been cut for condition reasons during exhibition planning, and was never at the MCCM. It was the Rose Library\\'s copy that was in the exhibition. Again, due to internal miscommunications at MCCM, the Rose Library copy was never included on the loan paperwork, given a loan number or entered into TMS. This was discovered when Julie Newton from Rose Library came to deinstall the Rose and Pitts books. Julie confirmed that the Pitts copy was at her bench in the conservation lab at the library, and had been for the entire run of the exhibition. Julie also confirmed that she deinstalled the Rose Library copy at the end of the exhibition at MCCM and returned it to Rose Library. For accuracy of  the record keeping/exhibition history, the Rose copy was retroactively given a loan number (L2019.006.011) and added to the exhibition record. The Pitts library copy was changed to a cancelled loan and removed from the exhibition record. As the Pitts copy is credited in the catalog, Through a Glass Darkly remains in its Published References. L2019.006.010 (loan from Rose Library) was cut from exhibition during planning stages.

DAC. 2013 permanent collection gallery label: International Trade Through extensive overland and maritime trade routes, Mesopotamian cultural influence spread throughout the Near East, including Egypt, Syria, and the Levant, Arabia, and even India. Carved stone vessels made from chlorite have been found from sites as far to the north as Palmyra in the Syrian Desert, to the east at Mohenjo Daro in India’s Indus River Valley, and to the south at Umm al-Nar in Arabia. Produced and extensively traded during the third millennium BC, these vessels were carved in a distinctive “intercultural style,” with geometric and floral motifs, and architectural and animal scenes with attacking felines, bulls, and entwined serpents. More examples of “intercultural style” vessels have been uncovered at Tarut Island in Arabia than anywhere else in the Near East. Such large numbers of vessel finds suggest that Tarut Island was a possible production or distribution center for the vessels or it may have been one of the first stops and a major consumer on a trade route running between Mesopotamia and the southern Iranian plateau, the main source for chlorite. The recently discovered site of Jiroft in Iran also appears to have been a production center for these vessels, which were considered luxury products. Although they appear in royal cemeteries and in palace and temple settings in Mesopotamia, their primary use on Tarut Island may have been funerary, since the majority were discovered in stone-lined tombs. Mesopotamia was an important cultural influence on the development of the early Egyptian state, as indicated by ceramic and architectural styles and the use of both cylinder seals and a writing system. Influence from Mesopotamia is evidenced in the Bactrian cultures of Afghanistan, where local versions of Sumerian votive figures were produced, often as composite stone sculptures. In later times, camel caravan routes bringing trade goods from Mesopotamia and the Levant southward into Arabia enriched the kingdoms of ancient Yemen, home of the biblical Queen of Sheba. 1. Bowl.

Permanent collection gallery: INTERNATIONAL TRADE Through extensive overland and maritime trade routes, Mesopotamian cultural influence spread throughout the Near East, including Egypt, Syria and the Levant, Arabia, and even India. Carved stone vessels made from chlorite have been found all over the Near East from sites as far to the north as Palmyra in the Syrian Desert, to the east at Mohenjo Daro in India\\'s Indus River Valley, and to the south at Umm al-Nar in Arabia. Produced and extensively traded during the third millennium bc, these vessels were carved in a distinctive ¿intercultural style¿ with geometric and floral motifs, and architectural and animal scenes with attacking felines, bulls, and entwined serpents. More examples of ¿intercultural style¿ vessels have been uncovered at Tarut Island in Arabia than anywhere else in the Near East. Such large numbers of vessel finds suggest that Tarut Island was a possible production or distribution center for the vessels. It also may have been one of the first stops on a trade route running between Mesopotamia and the southern Iranian plateau, the main source area for chlorite. The recently discovered site of Jiroft in Iran also appears to have been a porduction center for these vessels, which were considered luxury products. Although they appear in royal cemeteries and in palace and temple settings in Mesopotamia, their primary use on Tarut Island may have been funerary, since the majority were discovered in stone-lined tombs.

A February 14, 1997 file memo from registrar Lori Iliff discussed how sources and provenance were determined for objects that were believed to have an Etowah or Etowah-related provenance. This memo did not discuss the X.0600-X.0697 numbered objects, as the sources and provenance of those objects had been discussed in a March 1990 memo. Information regarding the objects in the 1997 memo came from the Accession Log I (green-blue colored ledger) and old accession sheets. According to Lori\\'s memo it was unclear when the accession log was started, but it was on or prior to 1984. The accession worksheets had been created in 1984. According to Lori\\'s memo, the designation of Etowah as provenance and Phillips Academy as source on the accession worksheets seemed arbitrary and not based on prior museum records. Therefore the designation of Etowah or Phillips Academy based solely on an accession worksheet may be suspect. Below is a summary of what was found for this object. X.0232.028.002 - According to the memo, the accession log lists no source, but lists Etowah as provenance. The memo does not mention an accession worksheet. There is a 1984 accession worksheet in the object file. It notes the provenance as Georgia, Etowah Mounds and does not note a source. The memos from the 1990s do not mention the \"Specimen Record\" worksheets housed in the blue fabric-covered binders. A few of these worksheets contain notes added by Lori Iliff in 1994. It is unclear why these worksheets are not mentioned in the 1990s memos, but for completeness, their information is noted here. It is however, unclear when these worksheets were created, by whom, and where the information in the worksheets came from. Many have notes regarding packing objects for storage in 1982, so it can be assumed these were created in 1982 or earlier. A Specimen Record for X.0232.028.002 cannot currently be located.

Permanent collection galleries 133A: UNDERWATER ARCHAEOLOGY While the prospect of discovering submerged cities and sunken treasures has sparked the imagination of many through the ages, it was only in the last decades of the twentieth century that the systematic exploration of the depths of oceans and lakes became feasible. Revolutionary diving equipment, developed by innovators like the French oceanographer Jacques Cousteau and the American industrialist and aviation engineer Edwin A. Link, made the methodical exploration of underwater sites possible. Sophisticated new equipment has recently proven that navigation in antiquity was not limited to coastal sailing as was previously believed, but that high seas crossings were also undertaken. Locating, mapping, excavating, conserving, and reconstructing maritime sites and their artifacts have made an invaluable contribution to our knowledge of economics and everyday life in antiquity. While Phoenicians and Greeks were recognized as the most successful early merchants and navigators, the Romans, through their vast territorial conquests, greatly extended the range of trade and degree of interconnection between peoples. Objects in this case were recovered from the ancient harbors of Syracuse (in modern-day Sicily) and Caesarea (in modern-day Israel), as well as from the Sea of Galilee. top and center Amphora (Storage Vessel).

MCCM Permanent Collection Gallery, 2013: Near Eastern Glass Ancient glass was made from a mixture of silica, lime, and alkali, materials easily available in the Levant. Silica and lime were obtained from ordinary sand, and alkali from plant ashes, which contained a great deal of natrium. These materials would be heated to about 1100 degrees Celsius, the temperature at which they would turn liquid and become workable. Colors were created by adding metal oxides during the process of fusion. The metallic, multicolored sheen on the surface of some of these objects, called iridescence, was not original, but caused by chemical reactions that occurred during nearly two thousand years of burial in the earth. 1.

Silica and lime were obtained from ordinary sand, and alkali from plant ashes, which contained a great deal of natrium. These materials would be heated to about 1100 degrees Celsius, the temperature at which they would turn liquid and become workable. Colors were given by adding metal oxides during the process of fusion. The metallic, multicolored sheen on the surface of some of these objects, called iridescence, was not original, but caused by chemical reactions that occurred during nearly two thousand years of burial in the earth. 1.

Silica and lime were obtained from ordinary sand, and alkali from plant ashes, which contained a great deal of natrium. These materials were heated to about 1100 degrees Celsius in order to turn liquid and become workable. Colors were given to the glass by adding metal oxides during the process of fusion. The metallic multicolored sheen on the surface of some of these objects, called iridescence, was caused by the chemical reactions that occurred in the earth where they lay buried for nearly two thousand years. It is unknown exactly when glass was first made. Glass vessels originally made around a core appeared in Mesopotamia and Egypt around 1500 BC. In the first century BC, glass blowing was invented somewhere along the Syro-Palestinian coast, which was then part of the Roman Empire. This revolution in the history of glass allowed the rapid production of vessels of virtually any design. Glass, previously considered very precious, was cheaper as a result and became an important trade commodity, used not only for cosmetic vessels (1-25) and jewelry (41-46), but for tableware (26-40), household vessels, lamps, and cremation urns. 1-3. The oldest known glass core-formed vessels date around 1500 BC and were found in Western Asia. They became very popular around the Mediterranean world in the first millennium BC, and only went out of fashion with the invention of glass blowing. These vessels were made around a disposable core of material (clay or sand mixed with an organic binder), fashioned according to the interior shape of the desired vessel and placed on top of a metal rod. The core was then covered with hot glass by trailing threads of glass of various colors around it. The vessel was repeatedly heated in an oven and rolled on a flat stone between the application of glass; the handles, the mouth and the foot of each vessel were applied and shaped afterwards. Once the vessel was finished, the core was scraped out and the vessel was then ready to be filled with scented oil, unguent, or makeup powder. 4. These vessel fragments mainly from shallow bowls, were manufactured in Rome during the first century BC and early first century AD and illustrate the diversity of Roman mosaic glass. Although mosaic glass had been invented by Hellenistic glassmakers in the second half of the third century BC, the Roman glassmakers of the Augustan and Julio-Claudian periods brought this technique to new heights. The Roman mosaic vessels were made from sections or from lengths of monochrome or polychrome mosaic glass canes that were cast in a mold before being fired. In some cases, the sections and lengths of the rods were intertwined together. 5-40. In the first century BC, somewhere in the Eastern Mediterranean region, glassmakers discovered the wonderful ability of glass to swell into a bubble when a drop of molten glass is inflated through an iron blowpipe. This glass bubble can then be tooled into various forms and will harden, retaining its shape upon gradual cooling. The free-blown glass vessels were all based on the natural shape of the glass bubble, but glass could also be blown in a mold (8). This still hot glass vessel could be engraved, and glass threads could be applied. Before cooling off, some vessels could be joined together to form double unguentaria (perfume bottles) (24). 1.

Use for art produced for rituals commemorating the dead and for art produced as an individual expression of grief. Roman Glass 1st  to 4th Century A.D. Up until the Roman Period, glass was a luxury product painstakingly crafted by artisans working with barley melted raw glass. Improvements in furnace design, however, allowed the glass to become thoroughly melted and made blown glass possible. Thin walled glass vessels were produced and transported throughout the ancient word. The non-porous glass was ideal for holding perfumes and oil, which would seep out through porous pottery containers. The iridescent sheen found on weathered ancient Roman glass inspired Louis Comfort Tiffany to create his famous ¿favrile glass¿. 13.\\tBottle. Lent by the Michael C.

MCCM Permanent Collection Gallery, 2013: Near Eastern Glass Ancient glass was made from a mixture of silica, lime, and alkali, materials easily available in the Levant. Silica and lime were obtained from ordinary sand, and alkali from plant ashes, which contained a great deal of natrium. These materials would be heated to about 1100 degrees Celsius, the temperature at which they would turn liquid and become workable. Colors were created by adding metal oxides during the process of fusion. The metallic, multicolored sheen on the surface of some of these objects, called iridescence, was not original, but caused by chemical reactions that occurred during nearly two thousand years of burial in the earth. 1.

These materials were heated to about 1100 degrees Celsius in order to turn liquid and become workable. Colors were given to the glass by adding metal oxides during the process of fusion. The metallic multicolored sheen on the surface of some of these objects, called iridescence, was caused by the chemical reactions that occurred in the earth where they lay buried for nearly two thousand years. It is unknown exactly when glass was first made. Glass vessels originally made around a core appeared in Mesopotamia and Egypt around 1500 BC. In the first century BC, glass blowing was invented somewhere along the Syro-Palestinian coast, which was then part of the Roman Empire. This revolution in the history of glass allowed the rapid production of vessels of virtually any design. Glass, previously considered very precious, was cheaper as a result and became an important trade commodity, used not only for cosmetic vessels (1-25) and jewelry (41-46), but for tableware (26-40), household vessels, lamps, and cremation urns. 1-3. The oldest known glass core-formed vessels date around 1500 BC and were found in Western Asia. They became very popular around the Mediterranean world in the first millennium BC, and only went out of fashion with the invention of glass blowing. These vessels were made around a disposable core of material (clay or sand mixed with an organic binder), fashioned according to the interior shape of the desired vessel and placed on top of a metal rod. The core was then covered with hot glass by trailing threads of glass of various colors around it. The vessel was repeatedly heated in an oven and rolled on a flat stone between the application of glass; the handles, the mouth and the foot of each vessel were applied and shaped afterwards. Once the vessel was finished, the core was scraped out and the vessel was then ready to be filled with scented oil, unguent, or makeup powder. 4. These vessel fragments mainly from shallow bowls, were manufactured in Rome during the first century BC and early first century AD and illustrate the diversity of Roman mosaic glass. Although mosaic glass had been invented by Hellenistic glassmakers in the second half of the third century BC, the Roman glassmakers of the Augustan and Julio-Claudian periods brought this technique to new heights. The Roman mosaic vessels were made from sections or from lengths of monochrome or polychrome mosaic glass canes that were cast in a mold before being fired. In some cases, the sections and lengths of the rods were intertwined together. 5-40. In the first century BC, somewhere in the Eastern Mediterranean region, glassmakers discovered the wonderful ability of glass to swell into a bubble when a drop of molten glass is inflated through an iron blowpipe. This glass bubble can then be tooled into various forms and will harden, retaining its shape upon gradual cooling. The free-blown glass vessels were all based on the natural shape of the glass bubble, but glass could also be blown in a mold (8). This still hot glass vessel could be engraved, and glass threads could be applied. Before cooling off, some vessels could be joined together to form double unguentaria (perfume bottles) (24). 1.

According to a file memo written in March 1990 by registrar Lori Iliff, the large group of Native North American objects now numbered X.0600-. X.0697 were not registered until 1990, though they had been in the museum for decades. At the time they were stored in what were assumed to be their original boxes. In some cases, original tags were found with the objects identifying the source. In some cases there were no tags, but a tentative source was noted if other objects in the box had a source. X.0652 - X.0697 had no tags, but were found stored with other objects identified as being from W.H. Ferguson. At the time of the 1990 inventory, it was decided to note the source for these as \"Ferguson (?)\". Due to the inconclusive nature of this evidence, W.H. Ferguson does not appear as a constituent for these objects, but TMS still lists \"Gift of W.H. Ferguson(?) in the credit line field. Additionally, in the W.H. Ferguson accession file, there is an old label that reads \"Indian Artifacts Donated to Emory University Museum by Mrs. Lois Rodgers. Found in Northern Arkansas. February 22, 1966\". There is an additional handwritten note that states that during the 1990 inventory of the Native North American objects, none could be identified as having been donated by Lois Rodgers. The handwritten note states that these objects may have been combined with W.H. Ferguson\\'s objects. It is possible that some of the objects in the X.0652-X.0697 group are some of these objects. According to the 1990 accession worksheet, X.0679 was found in Box 65. According to an undated, handwritten inventory of the boxes, Box 65 contained \"8 rounded game stones, 11 grinders, 1 large mortar, 1 small mortar, 5 spear heads, 6 assorted axe heads, 4 holed stones – to attach to stick, Box #1 – 221 Arrowheads (Ferguson), Box #2 – 116 Arrowheads\". According to the Ancient Near Eastern Collection Galleries binders, the 1993 installation opened on May 11, 1993. A few modifications to cases were made between the original installation and when the galleries were deinstalled in spring 2001: In January 1995, 1994.012, Statue of a Bull was installed in gallery 111 until it was installed in The Art of Collecting exhibition (November 8, 1997 - January 4, 1998). Unclear what, if anything was installed in gallery 111 from May 1993 until January 1995. 1994.012 does not appear to have been reinstalled in 111 after the Art of Collecting closed. From February - May 1997, 1985.014.010 was removed from case 112D, Near Eastern Glass to be included in the Exploring Authenticity exhibition. It was reinstalled in case 112D after Exploring Authenticity closed. In September 1996 the objects from the L1993.008 amd L1993.011 loans in case 112E were returned to the lenders. The objects from the L1993.001 loan was returned to the lender in June 1997. It is unclear what, if anything, was installed in case 112E after the loan returns.

Plume in form of skate instead of a stingray. 2013 Reinstallation label: Precious Metal as Personal Adornment A hierarchy of precious metals existed in the ancient Andes: gold was preeminent, then silver, gilded copper, and lastly plain copper. Here gold tweezers (4, 5, 7–11), though diminutive, were highest in status, then the silver items (1, 2, 6, 12, 13), and finally, the gilded copper earspools (3). Gold always outranks the other metals because it does not tarnish or rust, while silver oxidizes and turns black, and copper turns green and eventually disintegrates. The immutability and reflective superiority of gold translates into social status throughout world cultures. Many items of personal adornment were made from precious metals. Headgear, often in the form of a crescent, may be decorated with felines and tied on with a thread (1) or take the shape of a stingray or skate whose tail penetrated the hair (2). These gave the wearer a more imposing silhouette and placed their shamanic spirit animals on their head, the appropriate location since visions are associated with the fontanel. Amerindian men genetically grow very little body hair, especially facial hair, encouraging the creation of elaborate tweezers (4–13). They utilize the natural flexibility of metal alloys, which bend to grasp the hair and flex to return to their original shape. Decorated with birds or different elemental shapes, they become artistic objects, sometimes called “art-tools” by scholars. High-status men throughout the indigenous Americas wore earspools (3), like a spool of thread pushed through a large hole in the earlobe. This pair features spiders in cut out webs, and traces of the gold layer over the now-green copper show they were originally gilded. The Moche identified with the spider, an animal that captures its prey and sucks out its blood—they took prisoners and ceremonially bled them from the neck, presenting a goblet of blood to the High Priest. Thus, someone who would wear these middle-status gilded copper spider earspools probably participated in such a ritual, but occupied a lesser position, perhaps someone who lead the prisoners. 1.

KAREL APPEL: FORM BECOMES VIBRATION Dutch artist Karel Appel was one of the founders in 1948 of Cobra, an international avant-garde movement originated by a group of European artists in the wake of the Second World War. Cobra was an acronym for Copenhagen,  Brussels and Amsterdam, the artists' native cities, all of which had suffered under Nazi occupation. In reaction to the horrific oppression of the war years, the Cobra artists rejected all artistic and political dogma and sought an expression uninhibited by the constraints of reason. Their interests paralleled other artistic movements of the post-war years. Like l'art brut  (¿raw art¿) of Jean Dubuffet in Paris, the art of Cobra found its inspiration in the untutored spontaneity of folk art, the art of children, and the art of the insane. Its instinctive and improvisatory approach was also akin to Abstract Expressionism in New York. While the Cobra artists displayed a stronger interest in figural representation than their American counterparts, the apparent ferocity of the encounter between the artists and their materials is similar to that seen in the works of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning. In response to the Dutch tradition in modern painting, Appel claimed the energetic expressionism of Vincent van Gogh as his own and disavowed the orderly, rational abstract geometry of Piet Mondrian. Although the formal collaboration of the Cobra artists was short-lived (1948-1951), he has remained true in his work to the ideals of playful experiment and immediacy of feeling. Over the years Appel has continued to depict the same childlike motifs-antic human faces and fanciful animals; but the style of their depiction has been constantly changing. The works in the current exhibition were all produced within a few years of each other in the late 1970s. At that time Appel adopted a new manner of expression using thick, parallel strokes of vivid, contrasting colors in both his paintings and prints. Perspective and traditional modeling are totally absent in these works; both figure and background are built up with the same densely-packed welts of pigment. Appel has described the rhythmic, emotionally charged-brushstrokes of this style, saying, ¿In my painting the form becomes vibrations, it enters the formless form, formless existence that I paint-vibrations of colors. ¿ APPEL ON APPEL In  1978 Appel defined his work as ¿the art of expressing something that is not really there. . . . It is embodied in a rhythm of colors which also embraces the beholder. The brushstroke is of so much importance,  . . . to point something out which does not really exist. . . playful creatures, profoundness, jokes, sudden turns. Loud colors are involved in portraying the present moment, all this in order to try to catch or hit on the essence, the true substance of things. ¿ Karel Appel (Dutch, b. 1921 Whirling Head 1978 Acrylic on paper Gift of Bertram Podell, 1981.2.2 Karel Appel (Dutch, b. 1921 Big Head Coming Down Lithograph Gift of Bertram Podell, 1981.2.6 Karel Appel (Dutch, b. 1921 Tibetan Bird Lithograph Gift of Bertram Podell, 1981.2.7 Karel Appel (Dutch, b. 1921 See Me Running Again Lithograph Gift of Bertram Podell, 1981.2.10 Karel Appel (Dutch, b. 1921 Flying Fish 1977 Acrylic on wood Gift of Bertram Podell, 1981.2.17 Appel has explored the representation of intensely felt experience in sculpture as well as in painting. Early in his career he began to make constructions out of discarded materials, the junk encountered in his daily travels around Amsterdam. His assemblages of found objects evolved over the years into reliefs and free-standing works composed of strongly outlined shapes, cut from wooden planks in various sizes, painted in brilliant colors and superimposed upon one another. Flying Fish  demonstrates the broad humor  that underlies much of Appel's work and tempers the violence of his expression.\", 'Subjective': 0, 'Gender': 0, 'Jargon': 0, 'Social': 0}, {'ObjectID': 735, 'Description': 'A Cedar of Lebanon No provenance information in files.

At the conclusion of the Pop-up conservation lab, the object will be installed in the MCCM Permanent Collection Asian galleries. Description from MCCM website: The Parsons Conservation Laboratory is located on the Plaza Level of the Carlos Museum, in an area accessible only to staff. In celebration of the museum’s centennial, conservators have set up a temporary lab space in the John Howett Works on Paper Gallery. Through the end of September, a team of staff and consulting conservators assisted by student interns will work to stabilize the Cosmic Man, an Indian painting that is a visual representation of the Jain universe. In order to prepare the fragile painting for display, conservators will secure loose paint, reduce surface dirt, relax folds, and attach the painting to a rigid support. Conservators will work several hours a day Tuesday through Friday. See team members at work on a special weekend workday, Saturday, September 7, from 1-5 PM, and learn more about the process at the Conservation Conversation panel discussion Tuesday, September 19, at 7:30 PM.

Notes from 3/2/2021 exhibition project meeting: Catalog is being created using Getty Quire platform with assistance from ECDS, allowing for presentation on web, ebook, or pdf formats. The semester will begin 1/11/2022, but the exhbit will not open until 1/22/2022. Ganzeer will begin painting his mural prior to the opening and will continue for several days after the opening. Amie Esslinger will likely do the same. Esslinger\\'s installation is intended to begin on panels flanking the ramp entrance in 314 and will continue onto the ramp walls. She will incorporate the handrails and emergency exit into her planning. Anida Ali will travel for installation and will return mid-semester for additional, possibly offsite, performances and programs. Cannupa Hanska Luger\\'s pieces will travel on the mannequins, ready for installation. He will travel for programming only and will not be present for installation. Amanda and Elizabeth will complete programming planning mid-march 2021. Loan agreements can go out early-April 2021.

Notes from 1/27/2021 meeting with curator Amanda Hellman: The loan from Santa Barbara Museum of Art (L2021.001) has been eliminated. An identical photo by Yinka Shonibare is instead being borrowed from Cohan Gallery NY (L2022.018). The object is framed, but it will require crating and shipment from NY. Photos by Kahn and Seleznick will be shipped from the artists to Jackson Fine Art in Atlanta as part of a shipment of multiple works. MCCM will pay a pro-rata contribution toward the shipment. All pieces will be returned to Jackson Fine Art at the close of the exhibit. Cannupa Hanska-Luger is creating a new work for the exhibition. It will be 2 costumed mannequins with an accompanying video. He will book his own crating in Santa Fe, billing MCCM. The costmes will include raw, organic elements, and Hanska-Luger has agreed to our freezing them to prevent infestation. MCCM staff will install, and Hanska-Luger will not travel as a courier. Laeila Adjovi (L2021.005) will travel from Senegal with the wings (L2021.005.008) as excess baggage in a carrying case. Her photos will be printed and framed to order and shipped from her printer in Paris. All pieces will return to Senegal, potentially with Amanda Hellman as courier. Anida Ali\\'s pieces (L2021.006) will all ship from Seattle, and only 1 of the four elements of the Buddhism Bug will be available for our installation. She will still come as courier for installation and opening performances, with no other changes to the original plan. There are no changes to plans for Thameur Mejri\\'s loans (L2021.004). Three objects have been deleted from Fabrice Monteiro\\'s loan (L2021.003.001, .004, and .007). There are no changes to plans for Steve Bandoma\\'s loans (L2021.002). There is no change to the site-specific mural planned by Ganzeer. Amanda would like to add a site-specific installation from local Atlanta artist, Annie Esslinger. 2 additional venues are being considered for travel of the exhibition: University of Michigan Museum of Art and UCLA Fowler Museum. Curator has suggested a $35,000 loan fee with pro-rata fees for crating/shipping, courier travel, and artist travel, as well as a performance from Anida Ali. The exhibition was moved to Spring 2022, postponing it from its original Spring 2021 slot, due to predicted COVID-19 budget shortfalls.

Permanent collection galleries 130C: JERICHO Middle Bronze Age The arrival of new groups of people in the Levant during the Middle Bronze Age (2000-1550 BC) spurred the establishment of new cities and the reconstruction of others abandoned at the end of the Early Bronze Age. These newcomers were already urbanized through contacts with the coastal towns of southern Syria such as Byblos. Similar traditions in architecture, burial customs, pottery, and metallurgy were brought to the southern Levant in a fully developed and crystallized form. Jericho\\'s fortifications reflect that this period was one of prosperity, growth, and strong self-government. During the 18th century BC, Jericho\\'s defenses enclosed a larger area and were upgraded from mud-brick walls to a steep artificial slope of plaster-covered earth that raised the level of the new city walls. Evidence of industry is found in several parts of the city. A large number of loom weights in one building and over 50 querns (or mortars) in another suggest that weaving and grain milling were taking place on a commercial scale. Burnt ruins and debris reveal that Jericho\\'s Middle Bronze Age settlement ended violently in the 16th century BC, along with other towns and cities in the Levant. This turmoil was probably associated with the military unrest surrounding the Hyksos, western Semitic foreigners who were expelled from Egypt into the southern Levant. Though other towns in the region were rebuilt, Jericho was not reoccupied extensively until 1400 BC, a period from which little has survived. The city mound remained only sparsely settled up through the fourth century BC. Scant architectural remains and a small number of tombs indicate that the focus of settlement had already shifted from the city mound to the surrounding area, where the modern town of Jericho exists today. 1.

These newcomers were already urbanized through contact with the more advanced coastal towns of southern Syria, such as Byblos. Similar traditions in architecture, burial customs, pottery, and metallurgy were brought to southern Levant in a fully developed and crystallized form. Jericho\\'s fortifications reflect that this period was one of prosperity, growth and strong self-government. During the 18th century BC, Jericho\\'s defenses enclosed a larger area and were upgraded from a mudbrick wall to a steep artificial slope of plaster covered earth that raised the level of a new city wall. Evidence of industry is found in several parts of the city. A large number of loomweights in one building and over 50 querns in anther are evidence that weaving and grain milling were taking place on a commercial scale. The best evidence for life during the Middle Bronze Age comes from the tombs. Jericho\\'s population constructed or reused rock-cut tombs with shafts and subterranean chambers where furniture, mats, baskets, and wooden platters with food remains were found partially preserved. Pottery, jewelry, and other personal items including alabaster jars for oil or perfume, and scarab seals or amulets were also left with the dead. Burnt ruins and debris reveal that Jericho\\'s Middle Bronze Age settlement ended violently in the 16th century BC along with other towns and cities in the Levant. This turmoil seems most directly associated with the military unrest surrounding the ¿Hyksos¿, western Semitic foreigners who were expelled from Egypt into the southern Levant. Though other towns in the region were rebuild, Jericho was not reoccupied extensively until 1400 BC,  a period from which little has survived. The city mount remained only sparsely settled up through the fourth century BC. Scant archaeological remains and a small number of tombs indicate that the focus of settlement had already shifted from the city mound to the surrounding area, where the modern town of Jericho exists today. 1-9. Pottery made during the later Middle Bronze Age was of exceptional quality. A wide variety of graceful forms were fashioned entirely on a potter\\'s wheel. Most of the vessels were left undecorated though many were covered with a white or creamy slip (1). Throughout the 250 years of the Middle Bronze Age, specific shapes and styles were popular at certain times. In the earliest phase, globular bowls and piriform juglets (9) predominated while in the the next phase, flaring carinated bowls (6) and pedestal vases (5) appeared. In later periods, cylindrical juglets (7) were made and replaced the button vase variety (9). All the while, certain shapes, such as the dipper juglet (1) and storage jars (4) remained popular. 4. Though broken, this storage jar was valued by its owner and mended in antiquity. Holes were bored on either side of  the break and the crack was filled with plaster. The impression of a binding in the plaster indicated that cordage or fiber was laced through the holes to keep the break steady while the plaster dried. 8.  This juglet belongs to a group of vessels called Tell el-Yehuduyeh ware, after the site in the eastern delta of Egypt where the first examples were discovered  This ware is distinguished by its geometric decoration formed by a series of punctured holes. In addition to the Levant and Egypt, similar vessels have been found on Cyprus and demonstrate the trade and cultural homogeneity existing in the entire region during the ¿Hyksos¿ rule in Egypt. !3, 14. Objects made from organic materials like wood rarely survive the ravages of rot, insects and decay. In some of the Middle Bronze Age tombs, the natural processes of decay were mysteriously halted. Natural gases may have entered the tombs through faults in the stone caused by earth tremors, or the methane and carbon dioxide produced by the initial decomposition may have checked the decay in the airtight interior of some of the tombs. 15-22. Scarab seals were imported as well as locally produced at Jericho. The use of the scarab shape for seals and amulets reflects trade and close connections with Egypt. Though some of the seals note the names of ¿Hyksos¿ kings and officials, most examples were decorated with geometric designs and meaningless, false hieroglyphs. 1. Dipper juglet. Tomb P1.

Founded by Alexander’s general Ptolemy I, the Ptolemaic Dynasty established their capital in Alexandria, which became the cultural center of the eastern Mediterranean, renowned for its library, its scholars, and its artists. The prosperity of the Ptolemies was legendary, evidenced by the mass production of luxury goods, both for local consumption and for export to the thriving markets around the Mediterranean. Participation in the far-reaching Hellenistic economy demanded a coinage system, something lacking in Egypt prior to the Twenty-ninth Dynasty, which prompted the Ptolemaic rulers, and later the Roman emperors, to issue coins for use within Egypt. The Ptolemaic monarchs portrayed themselves as Egyptian kings and enthusiastically supported the Egyptian deities and temples. Private individuals also continued Egyptian traditions, dedicating votive statues in the temples and retaining funerary practices that had endured for centuries. Even so, Hellenistic influences became stronger and stronger, eventually diluting the beliefs and customs that had distinguished the lengthy history of the Egyptians. 1. Royal Relief Fragment. Egypt.

THE LEVANT: PERSIAN-BYZANTINE PERIODS (ca. 550 B.C.-A.D. 640) The Persian conquest of the sixth century B.C. had little impact on the culture of the Levant. With Alexander the Great\\'s conquest of the region in 333 B.C, new elements and forms of art were injected into local life. Hellenistic ideas and styles became the fashion until the Roman domination after 64 B.C., when a trend of standardization pervaded the Empire. The Romans provided the Levant an unprecedented level of security and prosperity. About A.D. 330, Christianity became the official religion of the Byzantine Empire. Throughout the region, churches were built while temples were destroyed, especially in Jerusalem, and religious conflicts destabilized the Levant. The period ended with the Muslim conquest of A.D. 640. 21-31. Coin finds are very important in dating archaeological strata and useful for investigating the spread of currency and foreign trade relations. The issue of coins was controlled generally by the state. Coins were also used, especially by the Romans, as a propaganda medium to influence public opinion and to record national history. 1. Bowl.

He probably studied with Adriaen van Ostade, and in his own day Bega was considered van Ostade\\'s best pupil. Like his teacher, Bega specialized in subjects of peasant life. But in contrast to van Ostade\\'s more indulgent treatments, Bega retained the powerful sense of satire so common to Dutch genre subjects before Rembrandt. Bega became a member of the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke in 1654, after travelling to Germany and Switzerland. He died in Haarlem a decade later.   Most surviving drawings by Bega are single figure studies, but a few multifigure compositions survive as well. All of Bega\\'s drawings are characterized by strong contrasts of light and shade and emphatic contours, characteristics he probably derived from his teacher van Ostade. There is an etching similar to the Carlos Museum drawing, and we may presume that the latter served as a preparatory study.     \"', 'Subjective': 0, 'Gender': 0, 'Jargon': 0, 'Social': 0}, {'ObjectID': 756, 'Description': 'Cylinder Vase with K\\'in (Sun) Symbols Purchase date and method taken from lists attached to donor tax forms (see accession lot).

Strategy of critical analysis arising in the mid-20th century, directed toward exposing unquestioned assumptions and internal contradictions in philosophical and literary language. OED. 2013 Reinstallation label: The Common Features of Ancient Mesoamerican Cultures Archaeologists define Mesoamerica (“Middle America”) as the area roughly between present-day Mexico City and Tegucigalpa, Honduras. Although numerous cultures rose and fell there since Neolithic times, certain common features united them: solar and ritual calendars (11, 12), the world’s first ballgame (8), foodstuffs such as maize (14) and turkey (13), ritualized music (5–7), and working of rare materials obsidian (1–3), Spondylus (spiny oyster) shell (4), and greenstone (9, 10). The Mesoamerican calendars are very complex (see “Counting Time in Ancient Mesoamerica” at left). Two were shared throughout: the 365-day solar and the 260-day ritual cycle. Here two Maya vessels concern calendrics: 11 displays painted k’in signs, each denoting a day or sun passage, while 12 illustrates a date in the ritual calendar “7 Ahau.” The black background suggests the k’in signs represent time passing in the Underworld, a dark place of creativity and challenge. The “7 Ahau” also references the Other Side by being written backwards—Ahau (the face) uncharacteristically placed to the left of the bar for 5 and dots for 2. Key Maya monuments show reversed writing in association with shamanic visions and “7” represents reflection and contemplation, while ahau denotes the top, leader, and completion. The Underworld was also celebrated in the Mesoamerican ballgame, a ritual contest made possible by the early discovery of rubber along the Gulf Coast. The Maya ballcourt markers often show animals—8 is a monkey, a character from the creation story that takes place mostly in the Underworld. In this tale, two sets of heroic twins battle the death gods and create humans from maize, ensuring life. The Young Maize God (14) appears as a handsome young man whose crosshatched patterns represent kernels and long feathers drooping from his head symbolize corn silk. Scientific tests of residue inside this vessel confirmed it originally held maize. Music and art were highly developed. Effigy rattles (10, 11) depict elaborately dressed Maya women and a figural flute from Veracruz contains sliding interior balls to create glissando effects (7). Elites wore precious jadeite earrings (9) and greenstone beads (10) and ear ornaments made from the thin, red-orange lining of the spiny oyster (Spondylus americanus) (4). Jadeite occurred in only one source and Spondylus oysters clung to rocks deep in the Caribbean—both very hard to  obtain. Likewise, obsidian (volcanic glass) had few sources and great skill was needed to slice razor-sharp blades (3) from cores (2) and to chip spearheads (1). 1. Bifacial Obsidian Spear Head Mesoamerica.

Permanent collection gallery: Late Classic Maya Ceramics Maya Cylinder Vessels (3, 5-7, 9, 10) were actually used to contain chocolate drinks (in Mayan languages kakaw [kah-kow], from which our word \"cocoa\" originates). Bowls (1, 4, 8, 11, 12) held the staple maize cereals and gruels; in fact, scientific tests of residue left in 11 revealed maize. By contrast, some vessels were intentionally rendered unusable: some flat plates (2) were \"killed\" by drilling a hole in their center. Such  vessels placed upside down over the face of the deceased were believed to allow the soul to exit the body. Most Maya ceramics were painted, but a few were incised (7, 11, 12). A band of carved glyphs (7), painted glyphs (5, 10), or, interestingly, painted imitations of glyphs (6) is often found around the rim. Pretend writing can be seen as a form of social climbing: in a society with a low literacy rate the appearance of readable glyphs added some prestige to a \"middle-class\" pot. The currently untranslatable glyphs in 10 read \"hok\" and \"bok.\" Of the over thirty Maya languages, not all have been deciphered yet. Painted designs range from simple brushstrokes (1) to patterns of shells (8), from monstrous supernatural heads (5) to abstract symbols that combine animal characteristics (6), from Underworld scenes (10) to signs for ? day? (3), and from the calendrical date \"7 Ahau\" (4) to extruded eyeballs (9). The most complex scene (10) depicts a struggle between a snake, a seated god about to stab the snake with his bloody axe, and a spear-bearer (not visible here, as extensive modern overpainting was removed from his torso). This piece epitomizes the complexity, elegance, and subtlety of the Maya artistic vision. 1.  Bowl with Abstract Brushstroke Design. Mesoamerica, Guatemala, Peten, Maya.

According to a file memo written in March 1990 by registrar Lori Iliff, the large group of Native North American objects now numbered X.0600-. X.0697 were not registered until 1990, though they had been in the museum for decades. At the time they were stored in what were assumed to be their original boxes. In some cases, original tags were found with the objects identifying the source. In some cases there were no tags, but a tentative source was noted if other objects in the box had a source. X.0652 - X.0697 had no tags, but were found stored with other objects identified as being from W.H. Ferguson. At the time of the 1990 inventory, it was decided to note the source for these as \"Ferguson (?)\". Due to the inconclusive nature of this evidence, W.H. Ferguson does not appear as a constituent for these objects, but TMS still lists \"Gift of W.H. Ferguson(?) in the credit line field. Additionally, in the W.H. Ferguson accession file, there is an old label that reads \"Indian Artifacts Donated to Emory University Museum by Mrs. Lois Rodgers. Found in Northern Arkansas. February 22, 1966\". There is an additional handwritten note that states that during the 1990 inventory of the Native North American objects, none could be identified as having been donated by Lois Rodgers. The handwritten note states that these objects may have been combined with W.H. Ferguson\\'s objects. It is possible that some of the objects in the X.0652-X.0697 group are some of these objects. According to the 1990 accession worksheet, X.0668.001-.010 were found in Box 65 and Box 66. According to an undated, handwritten inventory of the boxes, Box 65 contained \"8 rounded game stones, 11 grinders, 1 large mortar, 1 small mortar, 5 spear heads, 6 assorted axe heads, 4 holed stones – to attach to stick, Box #1 – 221 Arrowheads (Ferguson), Box #2 – 116 Arrowheads\". Box 66 contained \"13 axe heads (assorted sizes), 1 game stone, 8 celts\". It is unclear with objects in X.0668.001-.010 came from Box 65 and which came from Box 66. March 1995 descriptor added.

Carved stone vessels made from chlorite have been found from sites as far to the north as Palmyra in the Syrian Desert, to the east at Mohenjo Daro in India’s Indus River Valley, and to the south at Umm al-Nar in Arabia. Produced and extensively traded during the third millennium BC, these vessels were carved in a distinctive “intercultural style,” with geometric and floral motifs, and architectural and animal scenes with attacking felines, bulls, and entwined serpents. More examples of “intercultural style” vessels have been uncovered at Tarut Island in Arabia than anywhere else in the Near East. Such large numbers of vessel finds suggest that Tarut Island was a possible production or distribution center for the vessels or it may have been one of the first stops and a major consumer on a trade route running between Mesopotamia and the southern Iranian plateau, the main source for chlorite. The recently discovered site of Jiroft in Iran also appears to have been a production center for these vessels, which were considered luxury products. Although they appear in royal cemeteries and in palace and temple settings in Mesopotamia, their primary use on Tarut Island may have been funerary, since the majority were discovered in stone-lined tombs. Mesopotamia was an important cultural influence on the development of the early Egyptian state, as indicated by ceramic and architectural styles and the use of both cylinder seals and a writing system. Influence from Mesopotamia is evidenced in the Bactrian cultures of Afghanistan, where local versions of Sumerian votive figures were produced, often as composite stone sculptures. In later times, camel caravan routes bringing trade goods from Mesopotamia and the Levant southward into Arabia enriched the kingdoms of ancient Yemen, home of the biblical Queen of Sheba. 1. Bowl.

Originally part of a statue, this head may be associated with a Lihyanite sanctuary at the side dating to the fourth through third centuries BC, where similar male statues, perhaps representing deities, have been found. The Lihyans, a tribe who controlled the oasis after the fall of the kingdom of Dedan, left a considerable number of inscriptions in the region naming at least eight of their kings and the names of numerous gods and goddesses including the chief deity, Dhu-Ghabat. 1-3.

On February 12, 2024, a small puddle of water on the floor of gallery 314 was noticed by security staff. The puddle was traced to an area of damp ceiling near an HVAC vent, though there was no active drip at the time. No artwork had gotten wet, but out of an abundance of caution, 6 artworks that were near the other (dry) end of the ceiling vent were deinstalled (L2024.001.001, L2024.010.005, L2024.010.006, L2024.010.008, L2024.014.002 and L2024.015.002). Heavy rains had passed through for several days before, and the source was determined to be a roof leak. Over the next few days contractors repaired the roof and the artworks were reinstalled on the morning of February 20, 2024. On Wednesday, March 6, 2024, the leak in gallery 314 became active again. The same six works as before were deinstalled until alternative plans for installation could be determined. A plan was devised to create a temporary wall away from the leak zone wall. Lenders were contacted. The Met requested that both of their pieces in the exhibition (L2024.014.002 and .003) remain off view and in our secure storage for the remainder of the exhibition. All other lenders agreed to allow their objects in gallery 314 to be deinstalled for a few days to allow for the construction of the temporary wall. Exhibition was temporarily closed from March 25-March 28 for installation of the new temporary wall. All objects in 314 were deinstalled during this period. All objects in 314 (except for the two Met prints) were reinstalled by March 28 and the exhibition reopened to the public on March 29th.

The origins of Greek art can be traced far back into the Bronze Age (ca. 3000–1100 B.C.), when the Cycladic (1, 2), Minoan (7), and Mycenaean (3–6) civilizations flourished. Situated between mainland Greece, Crete, and Anatolia (modern Turkey), these islands played a vital role in the development of Greek civilization through trade and communication with other regions of the Mediterranean as well as through their growth as a distinct island society, fostered by the relative isolation of the sea. The famous Cycladic “idols,” of which numerous examples survive today, are the most characteristic form of Cycladic art. The so-called violin figurines (1) represent the earliest type of Cycladic sculpture, dating from the Early Cycladic I period of ca. 3000–2700 B.C.  The other figurine seen here (2) is of the so-called folded-arm type, a style associated with the Early Cycladic II period of ca. 3000–2700 B.C.

Bronze or lead votive statuettes (7) are a characteristic product of Minoan Crete:  a male worshipper, dressed in the conventional Cretan costume of tight belt and loincloth, raises his right hand to his forehead in a gesture of adoration. Distinctive Mycenaean stirrup jars (6), vessels for storage and export of wine and oil, have been found throughout the Mediterranean.

Although much about Greek Bronze Age culture remains enigmatic to us, we can appreciate many of their achievements, including the invention of early forms of the Greek language, the production of highly sophisticated works of art, and the construction of significant palaces and citadels.

The central zone of Honduras, however, was quite independent of its neighbors, expressing itself artistically in a unique marble carving tradition (4, 6). Western Honduras lay in the ancient Maya sphere, part of Mesoamerica, with the great city of Copán at its heart. Certainly the artistic environment was rich in influences. The famous Ulua marbles, named for a river valley in central Honduras, were carved from the only source of marble south of Georgia. The vessels’ designs feature fantastical feline handles, derived from earlier ceramic precedents (5), and surfaces carved with repeating snakehead patterns. Honduran individuality is apparent in all these works, such as the charming matched pair of stamps depicting jaguar-human shamans (3). Ceramic cylinder vessels (14) may have provided the original form for the highly prized marbles or may imitate higher-status marble wares. Western Honduras was part of the Maya world, so the artists of central Honduras were acquainted with this decidedly foreign culture.

Jericho During the Proto-Urban-Early Bronze Age (ca 3300-2300 BC) Jericho's last major settlement of the Neolithic period (8500-4300 BC) was abandoned during the fifth millennium BC. The site remained sparsely settled until the end of the fourth millennium when new settlers arrived and established a culture which formed the basis for the first urbanized center that developed later on the site. Out of these Proto-Urban origins, Jericho's Early Bronze Age culture emerged, drawing from local and new traditions filtering through the Levant from Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia. Jericho developed from an unsophisticated, agricultural village to an independent, urbanized town whose inhabitants built and maintained public works that included an extensive defensive wall, public buildings with brick pavement, and silos for the storage of grain.

Jericho developed from an unsophisticated, agricultural village to an independent, urbanized town whose inhabitants built and maintained public works that included an extensive defensive wall, public buildings with brick pavement, and silos for the storage of grain. The population of Jericho managed a successful economy largely based on the cultivation of cereals (wheat, barley), legumes (peas, lentils, chickpeas), and other plants, including dates, flax, and onions. Surviving artifacts reveal that trade existed with faraway regions and that specialized craftsmen, including metal workers, potters, and artisans of minor crafts also contributed to the economy. Raids by semi-nomadic peoples, Egyptians, or perhaps the arrival of western Semitic¿ Amorites¿ from Syria also may have contributed to the regional turmoil and demise of Jericho. Beads made of shell, turquoise, carnelian, and other materials not obtainable locally indicate that Jericho's population engaged in trade with other regions including the Eastern Mediterranean, the Sinai, and Anatolia. Shapes of the period included storage jars, cooking pots, deep kraters (mixing vessels for wine), jugs, juglets (16-22) and amphoriskoi (perfume or oil bottles). Unsuccessful. Extensive. Growing.

Ancient glass was made from a mixture of silica, lime, and alkali, materials easily available in the Levant. Silica and lime were obtained from ordinary sand, and alkali from plant ashes, which contained a great deal of natrium. The metallic multicolored sheen on the surface of some of these objects, called iridescence, was caused by the chemical reactions that occurred in the earth where they lay buried for nearly two thousand years. Glass vessels originally made around a core appeared in Mesopotamia and Egypt around 1500 BC. In the first century BC, glass blowing was invented somewhere along the Syro-Palestinian coast, which was then part of the Roman Empire. Glass, previously considered very precious, was cheaper as a result and became an important trade commodity, used not only for cosmetic vessels (1-25) and jewelry (41-46), but for tableware (26-40), household vessels, lamps, and cremation urns. The oldest known glass core-formed vessels date around 1500 BC and were found in Western Asia. The oldest known glass core-formed vessels date around 1500 BC and were found in Western Asia. They became very popular around the Mediterranean world in the first millennium BC, and only went out of fashion with the invention of glass blowing. Once the vessel was finished, the core was scraped out and the vessel was then ready to be filled with scented oil, unguent, or makeup powder. Although mosaic glass had been invented by Hellenistic glassmakers in the second half of the third century BC, the Roman glassmakers of the Augustan and Julio-Claudian periods brought this technique to new heights. The Roman mosaic vessels were made from sections or from lengths of monochrome or polychrome mosaic glass canes that were cast in a mold before being fired. In the first century BC, somewhere in the Eastern Mediterranean region, glassmakers discovered the wonderful ability of glass to swell into a bubble when a drop of molten glass is inflated through an iron blowpipe. The free-blown glass vessels were all based on the natural shape of the glass bubble, but glass could also be blown in a mold (8). Before cooling off, some vessels could be joined together to form double unguentaria (perfume bottles) (24). 1. Trefoil Oinochoe (Pitcher). 2. Alabastron (Perfume or Oil Flask). 3.

The Atmosphere of Perfomance intro text: THE ATMOSPHERE OF PERFORMANCE: BALLET PHOTOGRAPHS BY GEORGE PLATT LYNES The legendary choreographer George Balanchine (1904-1983) once said, ¿Ballets are like butterflies. ¿  A live performance of dance is evanescent by nature, impossible to accurately and objectively record. Its movements are preserved only in the memories of the performers and audience. The great achievement of George Platt Lynes (1907-1955) was that he was able to conjure, in Balanchine's words, ¿the atmosphere of performance¿ in his meticulously staged photographs. In 1934 the Russian-born Balanchine and the wealthy American patron of the arts Lincoln Kirstein (1907-1996) established the School of American Ballet in New York City. With students trained in the school Balanchine and Kirstein formed various dance companies over the years, the American Ballet in 1935, the Ballet Caravan in 1936, the Ballet Society in 1946, and finally in 1948 the New York City Ballet (NYCB), the name under which it still performs today. When the American Ballet first began to perform, Kirstein asked Lynes, his friend from boarding school days and by then an established photographer known for his fashion shots and celebrity portraits, to photograph the dancers of the fledgling ballet company. This was the beginning of a twenty-year association in which Lynes provided images at cost to be used for posters, programs, and other promotions. Lynes did not attempt to document actual performances. The costumed dancers posed in the photographer's studio, where Lynes carefully arranged the lighting to lend a sculptural quality to the figures. Balanchine, who at times directed the dancers at the photographic sessions, predicted that the pictures would be ¿all that will be remembered of my own repertory in a hundred years. ¿ The Atmosphere of Performance label: 1995.11.7 Orpheus and Eurydice 1936 Gelatin silver print Gift of Linda Hyman Choreography: George Balanchine Music: Christoph Willibald Gluck Costumes: Pavel Tchelitchew Premiere: May 22, 1936, American Ballet Ensemble, Metropolitan Opera House, New York. Lynes called it his ¿good fortune¿ to be able to work closely with Balanchine who posed the dancers for this particular photographic session. In 1935 Balanchine and Kirstein had accepted an invitation to become the resident troupe of the Metropolitan Opera. In this production the opera singers performed unseen in the orchestra pit, while the dancers took the stage. The principal dancers were William Dollar as Amor, Daphne Vane as Eurydice, and Lew Christensen as Orpheus. The scenery and costumes designed by the painter Tchelitchev were quite innovative for the time. The production, however, was poorly received by both opera audiences and critics and was only presented twice. Lender has never returned any paperwork.

Permanent collection gallery: A Panamanian Grave The typical Panamanian grave, such as those at the cemetery of Sitio Conte, contained any number of smashed ceramics (5). The \"ritual killing\" of objects characterized almost all ancient American cultures. Purposeful defacing, breaking, or violent altering of artwork may have either been a politically motivated power statement or represented the desire to take prestige items out of economic circulation. Mutilation may also indicate the spiritual belief that all things have a life force that must be modified when the object goes into the Underworld. If plates were considered alive, they apparently had to be killed to properly accompany the deceased in the burial. In order to honor the ancient practices, a poorly restored pedestal plate was returned to the fragmentary state it had taken on in the grave (5). Before being smashed, it looked more like objects 1 and 6. Inversion (1) was another unusual way of treating pedestal plates in the Sitio Conte burials. Some of the many offerings were placed upright, but others were turned upside down to feature the underside. This inverted pedestal plate shows the care with which the underside was often painted. Ancient American artists paid attention to all sides of works of art out of respect for an object\\'s essential completeness, an important part of its being considered alive. This inverted burial position also served to give the Underworld, the mirror of the terrestrial world, its own perspective on the imagery. Other typical Panamanian grave goods included hand axes (2, 3), spear points (4), and plain ceramics (6). Panamanian hand axes were made from hard, practical stones and were usually broken from heavy use, showing that their actual function as land-clearing tools was paramount in their meaning when placed in the grave. Evidently they symbolized the agricultural prowess of the deceased and the belief that provisioning was to be continued in the afterlife. By contrast, the spear points were chipped from chert and jasper and may have been ceremonial, given their tiny size and striking colors of orange, green, and purple. The colors favored for the points are those found in ceramic slips, especially the orange and the purple. (Purple, seen in 1, is one of the most unusual slip colors known and, in the Americas, was developed only here and in the Andean Nasca culture.) Scattering multicolored points added another visually fragmented element in the burial. 1. Inverted Pedestal Plate with Underside Checkerboard Designs. Central     America, Panamá, Macaracas.

Permanent collection galleries 133A: UNDERWATER ARCHAEOLOGY While the prospect of discovering submerged cities and sunken treasures has sparked the imagination of many through the ages, it was only in the last decades of the twentieth century that the systematic exploration of the depths of oceans and lakes became feasible. Revolutionary diving equipment, developed by innovators like the French oceanographer Jacques Cousteau and the American industrialist and aviation engineer Edwin A. Link, made the methodical exploration of underwater sites possible. Sophisticated new equipment has recently proven that navigation in antiquity was not limited to coastal sailing as was previously believed, but that high seas crossings were also undertaken. Locating, mapping, excavating, conserving, and reconstructing maritime sites and their artifacts have made an invaluable contribution to our knowledge of economics and everyday life in antiquity. While Phoenicians and Greeks were recognized as the most successful early merchants and navigators, the Romans, through their vast territorial conquests, greatly extended the range of trade and degree of interconnection between peoples. Objects in this case were recovered from the ancient harbors of Syracuse (in modern-day Sicily) and Caesarea (in modern-day Israel), as well as from the Sea of Galilee. top and center Amphora (Storage Vessel).

Ancient Iran produced a distinctive tradition of fine ceramics that remained a major art form for millennia. The most significant regions with ceramic art were focused in northern Iran - along the Elburz mountains and south of the Caspian Sea; in the west along the Zagros mountains; and in the south and central lowlands, north of the Persian Gulf. Over the millennia, the influx of new peoples brought the introduction of a variety of ceramic traditions; while in many isolated mountainous regions, ceramic motifs and techniques survived for centuries. The ceramic vessels of ancient Iran were characterized by elegant rounded forms, often with narrow mouths or beak-like spouts. Two types of surface decoration usually were employed. Much of the fine ware features painted dark-on-white or buff-colored decoration with geometric designs or cursory depictions of goats, birds and bulls. Another surface technique, appearing on fine ware as well as on utilitarian or kitchenware, was achieved through the manipulation of firing conditions in the kiln to produce a red-orange or gray-black surface color. Both types of decoration were often enhanced by polishing or burnishing the pottery surface before firing to achieve a shiny, almost metallic sheen. 1, 2. Known as Kaftari ware, after the site where many examples were discovered, these vessels featured decoration with dark painted plump water birds and dense bands of geometric motifs. The spread of this distinctive decoration throughout southwest and southern Iran indicated the extent of Elamite influence in the regions during the second millennium BC. 3. Like southwestern Iran, the mountainous regions of western Iran also produced a tradition of dark-on-buff painted decoration. Storage jars with decoration restricted to the shoulders of the vessel were commonly left in tombs. The vessel shape, location of the decoration, and the waterbird motif reflects Elamite influence. 5, 8, 10.  The area of northern Iran, south of the Caspian Sea, produced a substantial ceramic industry dating from the end of the second millennium to the early first millennium BC. Tombs in the region, especially in the Gilan province, were richly furnished with attractive vessels of burnished red or gray ware. Many of the vessels, serving a ritual function, were made in the form of humped bulls, deer, and gazelles. More common ware, displayed here, was less elaborate and often decorated with simple incised or dotted motifs around the base of the necks (5) 11. During the first millennium BC, the region of central Iran, especially around Tepe Sialk, produced a tradition of beautifully painted ceramics comprising beaked jugs and cups with dark on white decoration. Bands of geometric motifs, including rays, lozenges, checkerboards, and rarer designs of animals were employed. 12. These figurines, found throughout the Persian Empire from Iran to the Levant, are often called ¿Persian riders¿ since their headgear, consisting of a hat covering the chin and cheeks, was the national headdress of the Persians. 1.

Glass, free blown 1985.14.10  Double Unguentarium Jerusalem, 3rd-4th centuries A.D.   Glass 1967.301  Double unguentaria were produced during the Roman period and later periods as a specialized vessel with two reservoirs used to hold precious perfumes and oils.  Although the double unguentarium on the left looks quite similar in shape to the one on the right, there are clues here which tend to make it seem rather modern.  For instance, it has no iridescence which is commonly found on ancient glass.  Iridescence is the metallic, multicolored sheen that is caused by chemical reactions during the centuries when the objects laid buried in the ground.  Also, the threads around the body of the vessel on the left are more like ones applied by contemporary glass makers.  In addition, the bottom of the left vessel is very flat and smoothly finished and seems to have been worked with a modern instrument.  Without a chemical analysis, it is difficult to ascertain if the unguentarium on the left  is ancient or a modern copy, but its craftsmanship tends to indicate the latter.

Johnston Family, 1989 Lithograph Gift of the artist, 1997.8 Nesbitt studied with noted artists Thomas Hart Benton and John de Martelly at the Kansas City Art Institute in the 1930s. Like his mentors and other Regionalist printmakers, he made prints for Associated American Artists, beginning in 1939. When interest in his pastoral subjects waned in the 1950s, Nesbitt moved to Atlanta to make industrial illustrations for Lockheed and later opened his own advertising business. By the time he retired in 1987, American Regionalist prints were once more attracting attention. Nesbitt began to work with master lithographer Wayne Kline at the Rolling Stone Press to make a series of prints based on drawings or paintings he had made earlier in his career. This representation of a family at church was improvised. The woman who once worked for Nesbitt\\'s mother is depicted with her own daughter, but the ¿father¿ was a man who frequently modeled at the Kansas City Art Institute in the 1930s. The woman\\'s crocheted shawl was actually a curtain taken down to add interest and texture in the lower right corner. Text from Jackson Lee Nesbitt: the Graphic Work: \"The woman in this picture worked for my mother back in Oklahoma and child is her daughter. The man was a model often used at the Kansas City Art Institute. I think Benton used him in his lithograph called Instruction. I made a drawingin 1939 and a painting in 1942 which won a prize at the Midwestern Art Expostion that year. I also painted a study of the woman by herself as a gift of my mother; that picture hangs in our home today. When I was designing the picture, I needed something to turn the lower right corner so I took the drapes down and got Elaine to model the shawl for me. That shawl turned out to be the hardest part of making the lithograph. I had to painstakingly dig out the white parts and draw in the small dark areas, all the while maintaining the look of a draped object.   Retif, Earl and Ann Salzer (eds.).

With Alexander the Great's conquest of the region in 333 B.C, new elements and forms of art were injected into local life. Hellenistic ideas and styles became the fashion until the Roman domination after 64 B.C., when a trend of standardization pervaded the Empire. The Romans provided the Levant an unprecedented level of security and prosperity. About A.D. 330, Christianity became the official religion of the Byzantine Empire. Throughout the region, churches were built while temples were destroyed, especially in Jerusalem, and religious conflicts destabilized the Levant. The period ended with the Muslim conquest of A.D. 640. 21-31. Coin finds are very important in dating archaeological strata and useful for investigating the spread of currency and foreign trade relations. The issue of coins was controlled generally by the state. Coins were also used, especially by the Romans, as a propaganda medium to influence public opinion and to record national history. 1. Bowl.

The series portrays the triumphal procession through Rome, capital of the Empire, of Caesar and his army. Vasari himself described this erudite and festive cycle as \"\"the best thing\"\" Mantegna ever did. While Mantegna\\'s star fell somewhat in succeeding centuries, in the present day Triumphs are considered the chief accomplishment of an astonishingly erudite and talented painter.   Purchased by Charles I, the Triumphs arrived in England from Mantua in 1629. Today they are installed at Hampton Court in the collections of Her Majesty the Queen. The fifth painting in the series is widely known by its informal title, The Elephants. The original is badly stained, but the composition survives in numerous prints made after the painting, including the example in the collections of the Carlos Museum, designed by Andre Andreani. Born in Mantua around 1540, Andreani trained as a painter but is chiefly known as a printmaker, an activity which brought him considerable fame. Andreani\\'s cycle, published in Mantua in 1598-99, is the first complete copy of Mantegna\\'s designs. They circulated widely in Europe and played a crucial role in the securing of Mantegna\\'s fame among critics and connoisseurs who did not have the opportunity to see the originals in England. The Andreani print is a chiaroscuro woodcut. The attraction of this technique lay in its power to mimick the highlights and toned backgrounds of wash drawings. Simply put, this technique involves the use of separate wood blocks inked in distinct tones, rather than a single block in a uniform tone. The separate blocks, rarely more than two, are printed separately on a single sheet through careful superimposition. Andreani was one of the earliest Italian artists to devote himself to this attractive technique, brought to Italy from the North.  \"', 'Subjective': 0, 'Gender': 0, 'Jargon': 0, 'Social': 0}, {'ObjectID': 2266, 'Description': 'Temple of Aphaia at Aegina Aegina.', 'Subjective': 0, 'Gender': 0, 'Jargon': 1, 'Social': 0}, {'ObjectID': 2267, 'Description': 'Shrine Figure (Ikenga)', 'Subjective': 0, 'Gender': 0, 'Jargon': 1, 'Social': 0}, {'ObjectID': 2269, 'Description': 'Pottery Fragment (Body) Depicting the Profile of a Human Figure and the Arm of a Second Figure Former MCCM object 1997.3.93 was determined, along with 1997.3.18, to be a fragment of a single whole.

Revolutionary diving equipment, developed by innovators like the French oceanographer Jacques Cousteau and the American industrialist and aviation engineer Edwin A. Link, made the methodical exploration of underwater sites possible. Sophisticated new equipment has recently proven that navigation in antiquity was not limited to coastal sailing as was previously believed, but that high seas crossings were also undertaken. Locating, mapping, excavating, conserving, and reconstructing maritime sites and their artifacts have made an invaluable contribution to our knowledge of economics and everyday life in antiquity. While Phoenicians and Greeks were recognized as the most successful early merchants and navigators, the Romans, through their vast territorial conquests, greatly extended the range of trade and degree of interconnection between peoples. Objects in this case were recovered from the ancient harbors of Syracuse (in modern-day Sicily) and Caesarea (in modern-day Israel), as well as from the Sea of Galilee. top and center Amphora (Storage Vessel).

The communities grew steadily, nowhere more so than at Constantinople, the city inaugurated with massive ambition by Constantine in 324 AD on the site of a former Greek city, Byzantium, as the capital of the Eastern part of the Roman Empire. Constantinople survived the Germanic invasions of Rome in the fifth century and lent its earlier name, Byzantium, to an important and sophisticated culture that would last until 1453 AD when Turkish troops led by Sultan Mehmed II finally broke through the city walls. Alongside representations of myths familiar from the classical world (17-22), we encounter commemoration of individuals like Thecla (25), a disciple of St. Paul, and the appearance of Christograms (23-24).

Its movements are preserved only in the memories of the performers and audience. The great achievement of George Platt Lynes (1907-1955) was that he was able to conjure, in Balanchine\\'s words, ¿the atmosphere of performance¿ in his meticulously staged photographs. In 1934 the Russian-born Balanchine and the wealthy American patron of the arts Lincoln Kirstein (1907-1996) established the School of American Ballet in New York City. With students trained in the school Balanchine and Kirstein formed various dance companies over the years, the American Ballet in 1935, the Ballet Caravan in 1936, the Ballet Society in 1946, and finally in 1948 the New York City Ballet (NYCB), the name under which it still performs today. When the American Ballet first began to perform, Kirstein asked Lynes, his friend from boarding school days and by then an established photographer known for his fashion shots and celebrity portraits, to photograph the dancers of the fledgling ballet company. This was the beginning of a twenty-year association in which Lynes provided images at cost to be used for posters, programs, and other promotions. Lynes did not attempt to document actual performances. The costumed dancers posed in the photographer\\'s studio, where Lynes carefully arranged the lighting to lend a sculptural quality to the figures. Balanchine, who at times directed the dancers at the photographic sessions, predicted that the pictures would be ¿all that will be remembered of my own repertory in a hundred years. ¿ The Atmosphere of Performance label: 1995.11.1 George Platt Lynes (American, 1907-1955) Portrait of Francisco Moncion as ¿Dark Angel¿ in Orpheus 1948 Gelatin silver print Gift of Linda Hyman Choreography: George Balanchine Music: Igor Stravinsky Costumes: Isamu Noguchi Premiere: April 28, 1948, Ballet Society, City Center of Music and Drama, New York Lynes and Balanchine collaborated closely on the photographs of the dancers in Orpheus. Balanchine described the sessions in 1956, ¿It was Lynes who arranged the lights from their decisive side and overhead angles (by far the hardest part). I posed the dancers and controlled the shutter. ¿  The success of this production led to an invitation for the Ballet Society to work along with the New York City Opera as a city institution, and the company became the New York City Ballet.', 'Subjective': 0, 'Gender': 0, 'Jargon': 0, 'Social': 0}, {'ObjectID': 2294, 'Description': 'Portrait of Jerome Robbins in title role of  \"Tyl Ulenspiegel\"', 'Subjective': 0, 'Gender': 0, 'Jargon': 1, 'Social': 0}, {'ObjectID': 2295, 'Description': 'Large Decorated Bowl No provenance information in files.

The resulting halves were then joined to create the vessel body and a separate handmade arching spout was added to complete the piece.

The exact meaning of this trio evades us, but certain possibilities can be suggested. Because of its accurate and ferocious nighttime hunting skills, the owl is an animal associated with both warriors and shamans.  Shamans work at night to defeat spiritual foes and would admire the seemingly magical way in which barn owls use their \"\"sight\"\" (actually sonar) to zero in on their prey, which they then decapitate.  Other Moche vessels depict owl-headed warriors and one an owl-headed female shaman curing a patient. Conch shell trumpets may have been blown in war and/or in ritual.

From the Bronze Age to the Islamic period, clay lamps were used in the Near East as an inexpensive, practical and easily produced means of illumination. The majority of Levantine lamps were manufactured by local workshops. Early lamps from the Bronze and Iron Ages were shaped by hand, while later examples were created on a potter's wheel or in two-piece plaster or clay molds. The wicks were ordinarily made from flax, and olive oil served as fuel. The desire and fashion for high quality and exotic products from outside the region sometimes led to the import of lamps and fragrant oils from other parts of the Mediterranean, particularly during the Roman period. 1-7. The systematic development of lamps in the Bronze and Iron Ages is illustrated by four-spouted lamps (1,2), used ca. 2300-2000 BC, and saucer lamps (3-7), used ca. 2000-586 BC. The simple form of the saucer lamp changed little over 1200 years, with only minor modifications to the rim, spout, and base. 8-10. The Hellenistic and Roman periods (late 4th century BC - 4th century AD) saw the infiltration of new ideas and outside traditions. The previously popular saucer lamp was replaced by such wheelmade examples as the ¿cornucopia¿ lamp (8) and the so-called ¿Herodian¿ lamp (11-13), recognizable by its spatulated, or bow-shaped nozzle. Most important, however, was the adoption of molds to make lamps (9), which allowed for mass production and an increased market. Mold-made styles ranged from imitations of Roman discus lamps (15, 16) to purely local forms. 23-32. The slipper shaped lamp, with molded decoration on the rim and nozzle, was characteristic of the Byzantine and Islamic periods. In the Byzantine period (5th - 7th centuries AD), the lamp featured such images as palm branches (24, 25), crosses (27), and Greek inscriptions (23). Decoration on early and medieval Islamic lamps (7th-14th centuries AD) consisted of vegetal (29-31) and geometric (28, 31) motifs. 1,2. Four-Spouted Lamps. Levant, Jericho, Tomb P24 and Tomb J28.

Permanent collection gallery: Crocodiles, Real and Unreal Only a few of the many works of art from ancient Costa Rica represent the crocodile as it appears in nature (5, 6), while most give the creature two heads (1, 2, 4, 7). Crocodiles shown more realistically, such as the pair of matched flutes (5, 6), feature the upturned heads, protruding eyes and nostrils, long teeth-filled jaws, and the body ridges characteristic of this awesome reptile. However, in these pieces the tails are necessarily shortened so as to function as a mouthpiece. In the double-headed images, which are much more common, the symmetrical heads serve as matching handles for bowls (1, 2), tripod vessels (7), or the bench on which a figure sits (4). However, this practical design feature does not explain the choice of the fantastical; a tail would work as a handle as well as another head. In the shamanic art of the ancient Americas, double-headed creatures, especially snakes and crocodilians, are ubiquitous. They may reflect the fact that all kinds of frightening things are experienced during the shaman\\'s ritual trance, including bizarre attacking crocodiles. The figure on the bench (4) is a key to this association of the supernatural with the two-headed crocodile. It depicts a female shaman whose popping eyes and bumpy head seem to suggest those features of the crocodile. Her legs are transforming into faces, and a snake encircles her waist. One hand-with ten fingers! -grasps a cup that might have held a mind-altering substance. She is a shaman in a trance, melding her human self with her animal one, and it is significant that she is elevated on a bench that sports two crocodile heads. This kind of bench has not been found archaeologically, so it may have been made of wood instead of a permanent material like stone. Another piece (7) joins the bicephalic (two-headed) crocodile with a painted bird design, probably a reference to shamanic trances that also involve a sense of flying like a bird. Shamans as dual beings, both crocodile and human, are depicted in 3. Diving downward, as if into the watery underworld, the applique figures feature human faces and arms along with ridged crocodile tails and back feet. 1. \\tFooted Shallow Bowl with Double Crocodile Heads.

Mon. , CA Exhibit intro text: Wondrous Transformations Photographs by Michael A. Smith ¿¿as I move the camera around, the world comes and goes, flattening itself into pictures. Wondrous transformations often occur ¿ small details can appear as landscapes and vast landscapes are sometimes diminished. ¿ (From a 1978 statement by the artist) Michael A. Smith, born in 1942 in Philadelphia, is a self-taught photographer who was originally drawn to the medium after seeing a television documentary about Edward Weston in 1965. As he began to experiment with taking pictures, Smith came to understand that the camera could do more than simply document elements of the real world, but could also transform these elements into aesthetic objects. Captivated by the clarity and detail that could be obtained with contact prints, he began to use view cameras early in his career. Smith chose the path of ¿straight¿ photography ¿ he does not crop or enlarge his images. When he wants to make larger images, he uses a larger format camera. The gelatin silver prints in this exhibition were all made either with an 8 x 10-inch or an 8 x 20-inch view camera. Smith¿s earliest photographs were made close to home and concentrate on the details of his environment, revealing an interest in abstraction and all over texture. In the mid-1970s Smith began to travel in the American West and shifted his focus to encompass sweeping vistas of uninhabited landscape. In most of these images, Smith excludes the line of the horizon, thus maintaining his concern with the textural qualities of the land. While on a picture-taking trip in 1978, he began to use the 8 x 20-inch view camera. Puzzled at first about what kind of photographs to make in this new format, he found a book that represented bird songs with graphs that showed the progression of notes and intervals across time. Smith realized that he wanted to make photographs ¿as beautiful as a bird song,¿ and he began to look for similar all-over patterns in the landscape. In composing his pictures he had always been as concerned with the edges as with the center of the frame and had held a preference for a ¿dense and tangled¿ texture that would compel the viewer to scan the whole picture from end to end. This, the inspiration of bird song, together with his interest in abstract form, led Smith to create these new documents of the American landscape. In the 1980s Smith began to receive commissions to photograph urban environments in Toledo and New Orleans and elsewhere, but he was still drawn back again and again to the grandeur of the countryside. In the last ten years he has journeyed beyond the United States to record the patterns of the Tuscan landscape, all the while revealing ¿wondrous transformations. ¿ Donor called Jasper Gaunt on 03/17/2009 to say she had never received gift paperwork.

The owl remained a favorite subject during the Salinar cultural phase on the North coast of 200 BCE-100 CE at the end of the Early Horizon and the beginning of the Early Intermediate Period. Other than the use of the spout and strap handle on many Salinar vessels (others do have the stirrup spout), they can perhaps be differentiated in form from the Tembladera and Cupisnique wares by a less organic fusion of the animal represented and the vessel body itself.

Invention and Revival into text: INVENTION AND REVIVAL: NORTHERN EUROPEAN PRINTS Prints are meant to be propagated. Artists carve wooden blocks or incise metal plates in order to make multiple impressions on paper of their designs, their inventions. Printmaking is a field rich with possibilities for experimentation. Artists are challenged to test the limits of the medium, to discover just how much can be expressed by making marks on wood or metal. Once it leaves the workshop a print can travel far to win fame for the printmaker and to serve as a model for other artists. Thus, experiments and inventions become a part of the history of printmaking, forming a tradition that succeeding printmakers will react to, revive, and reinvent. There are two basic forms of print processes-relief and intaglio. The woodcut is a relief process in which material is carved away from the lines of the design. Engravings, etchings, and drypoints are all intaglio processes in which lines are cut into a copper plate from which impressions will be made. In engraving a tool called a burin is used to gouge grooves directly into the plate. Etching allows an artist to draw more freely, scratching with a needle through a ground of resin, gum, or wax that has been applied to the plate. Once the design is complete the plate is bathed in acid which bites into the metal where the surface coating has been scraped away by the needle. In drypoint the artist works directly on the plate with a very hard needle that throws up a rough burr of metal on either side of the drawn line. Both woodcuts and engravings first appeared in Europe in Germany in the fifteenth century. Having mastered woodcut and engraving, Albrecht Dürer also tried his hand at etching and drypoint, but did not systematically pursue his efforts. Lucas van Leyden was the first artist to make etchings on copper plates and combined this process with engraving. Later in the seventeenth century etching became the preferred technique of artists, and Rembrandt regularly combined it with drypoint to add strong, dark accents to his prints. Invention and Revival label: JACQUES CALLOT (French, 1592-1635) The Miseries and the Misfortunes of War, 1633 Series of 18 etchings Art History Department Fund, 2001.4.1-18 Italy was always a source of inspiration for northern artists. In the early seventeenth century Jacques Callot of the Lorraine went there to perfect his knowledge of etching. He worked in Florence for many years for the Medici Grand Duke of Tuscany recording the theatrical pageants of the court and made several technical contributions to the craft of etching. Recalled to the north by the Duke of Lorraine at the time of the Thirty Years War, Callot created one of his greatest works, The Large Miseries and Misfortunes of War, a series that presents the life of a soldier in wartime, a tale of crimes and punishments. Frontispiece Translation of French inscription: The Miseries and the Misfortunes of War Represented by Jacques Callot, Lorraine Noble, and published by Israel his friend in Paris, 1633, with the Privilege of the King. Recruitment of Troops Inscription: That metal which Pluto encloses within his veins, which at the same time causes peace and war, draws the soldier, without fear of danger, from the place of his birth to foreign lands, where, having embarked to follow the military, his virtue must arm itself against vice. The Battle Inscription:  However rough may be the assaults of Mars and the blows that his arm strikes everywhere, that does not shake the invincible courage of those whose valor can combat the storm, and who, in order to win the name of warrior, shed the blood of their enemies for their own glory. Scene of Pillage Inscription:  These brutal courageous ones hide their thefts at hostelries with the honored name of booty. Enemies of repose, they purposely pick quarrels to avoid paying the host, and seize even the mugs. Thus, they take a fancy to other people's property when they have been made drunk and served as they desired. ------- Plundering a Farmhouse Inscription:  Here are the fine exploits of these inhuman hearts. They ravage everywhere. Nothing escapes their hands. One invents tortures to gain gold, another encourages his accomplices to perform a thousand heinous crimes, and all with one accord viciously commit theft, kidnapping, murder, and rape. Destruction of a Convent Inscription:  Here, in a sacrilegious and barbarous action, these maddened, avaricious demons pillage and burn everything, demolish the altars, laugh at the respect due to the Immortals, and drag from the holy places the disconsolate virgins, whom they dare to carry off to be violated. Plundering and Burning a Village Inscription:  Those whom Mars supports with his evil deeds, serve in this manner the poor country people. They take them prisoner, burn their villages, and even wreak havoc on their livestock. Neither fear of the Commandments, nor sense of duty, nor tears and cries can move them. Attack on a Coach Inscription:  In the seclusion of forests and deserted places, quite far from military drill duties, these infamous thieves lead the life of assassins, and their bloody arm deals only in robbery, so possessed are they with the cruel desire to take travelers' property and life. ------- Discovery of the Criminals Inscription:  After the commission of several low crimes by these good-for-nothing enemies of glory, they are sought everywhere with great diligence, and the camp provost marshal brings them back to quarters to receive, as they deserve, a punishment commensurate with their temerity. The Strappado Inscription:  It is not without cause that great captains have well-advisedly invented these punishments for idlers, blasphemers, traitors to duty, quarrelers, and liars, whose actions, blinded by vice, make those of others lax and lawless. The Hanging Inscription:  Finally these infamous and abandoned thieves, hanging from this tree like wretched fruit, show that crime (horrible and black species) is itself the instrument of shame and vengeance, and that it is the fate of corrupt men to experience the justice of Heaven sooner or later. The Firing Squad Inscription:  Those who, in obedience to their evil genius, fail in their duty, use tyranny, take pleasure only in evil and violate reason, and whose treason-filled actions produce a thousand bloody uproars in the camp, are thus chastised and shot. ------- The Stake Inscription:  Those enemies of Heaven, who a thousand times sin against the holy decrees and divine laws, glory in spitefully pillaging and destroying the temples of the true God with idolatrous hand, but as punishment for having burned them, are themselves finally sacrificed to the flames. The Wheel Inscription:  The ever-watchful eye of divine Astraea [Justice] completely banishes mourning from a region when, holding the sword and scales in her hands, she judges and punishes the inhuman thief who lies in wait for peasants, murders them, and toys with them, then becomes himself the plaything of a wheel. The Hospital Inscription:  See how the world goes, and how chance constantly pursues the children of the god Mars. Some, crippled, drag themselves along the ground. Others, more fortunate, receive promotion in war. Some die in a gallows by a fatal blow, and others go from the camp to the hospital. Dying Men by the Roadside Inscription:  How lamentable is the luck of the poor soldier! When the war is over, his misfortune starts again. Then he is compelled to go begging, and his poverty arouses the laughter of the peasant, who curses him when he asks for alms and considers it an insult to see before him the object of the afflictions he endures. ------- The Revenge of the Peasants Inscription:  After the soldiers have caused much destruction, finally the peasants, whom they have treated as enemies, await them in ambush in a secluded place, and having killed them by surprise, strip them to their shirts, thus avenging themselves on these unfortunate men for the loss of their property, due solely to them. Distribution of Rewards Inscription:  This example of a grateful leader who punishes evil and rewards the good, should prick soldiers with the goad of honor, since all their happiness depends on virtue, and they ordinarily receive from vice shame, scorn, and the extreme penalty. -------\", 'Subjective': 0, 'Gender': 0, 'Jargon': 0, 'Social': 0}, {'ObjectID': 6970, 'Description': 'Giza: Sections of the Gallery in the Great Pyramid Toward the end of the sixteenth century the popes began to re-erect the obelisks that had been brought to the city in ancient times.', 'Subjective': 0, 'Gender': 0, 'Jargon': 1, 'Social': 0}, {'ObjectID': 6979, 'Description': 'Sandzeichnungen Location verified, inventory 9, Spring 2005.

Spirited vessels: \"NUPE POTTERY STYLES  the surfaces of these vessels are covered with calligraphic patterning that is characteristic of the Nupe style. Potters draw on a shared decorative vocabulary of incised bands, crescents, diamonds, and zigzags, but configure them in unique ways for each vessel. There is considerable variety in the quality of line used to create the decorations on the pots shown here. The fine, controlled patterns on 1, 4, and 8 contrast with the thicker, deeper lines of 3, 5, 6, and the free-form gestural styles of 2 and 7. An alternating configuration of crescent patterns is observable in 6, 7, and 9. This gentle, undulating pattern creates the illusion of continuity and motion on the surface of these vessels. Such variations in surface design reflect the work of different groups of potters, each of whom specialize in the production of particular types of vessels. Some Nupe pots also feature an additional overlay of patterning that is applied once the pot is fired. For example, on 6, pastel colors were painted over already incised patterns to create a second layer of decoration. Because the pigment was applied after the pot was fired, it did not adhere permanently to the surface of the vessel and has faded over time. Other post-firing techniques add interest to Nupe pots as well. 4 and 10 retain the clay\\'s natural  colors. The dark, glossy surfaces of 3, 8, 9 were acheived with a wash of boiled shea-butter or locust bean. Similarly, a wash of Eroko tree bark turned 1 and 5 a vibrant sienna. The natural washes subtly alter the natural earth tones of the vessels. 1. Food Dish. Nigeria, Nupe potter. 20th century. Ceramic. l2001.4.40. 2-4, 7. 10  Water Storage Pots.

No one exerted a greater influence on the arts than Perikles: the redevelopment of the Acropolis and its buildings (such as the Parthenon) was his master-plan. Among the artists he commissioned were Phidias and the painter Polygnotos of Thasos.

Panama, Kuna, mid-20th century. 2013 Reinstallation label: Modern Panamanian Textile Art The Kuna, or Olotule (“Golden People”) as they call themselves, are traditional peoples who live in the Panamanian mainland and on the San Blas Islands. They are well known for creating textiles known today as molas [moh lahs]. Traditionally worn as panels in the front and back of women’s and girl’s blouses (1), but now also sold separately (2), they are brightly colored and extremely intricate in patterning. Molas are also very challenging to make, consuming much of Kuna women’s time and creative effort. Typical of many textile traditions, there are ancient aspects to mola design and imagery, but modern elements are also consciously incorporated, such as the use of machine-made cloth and process of cutting with scissors. Technically molas are “reverse appliqués”: instead of sewing down cut bits of cloth to a background, multiple layers of different colors of cloth are cut through to reveal those below and the edges of the openings are carefully turned under and sewn down. In the girl’s blouse (1) only two layers were used, orange over blue. The orange top layer was cut to form the four-part geometric design in which visually the blue and orange were painstakingly equalized. This defies the tendency for appliqué to be small details of one color spread over plain areas of another; just as in antiquity, artists refuse to bow to the easiest methods. The panel (2) is even more technically complex, with a top layer of red, then patches of various colors, and a final back layer of black. The patches make it possible to produce a truly multicolor design without an overly bulky thickness of cloth. Kuna imagery has cosmological as well as decorative implications. Molas evolved from paintings of sacred geometry and plants, and thus have protective powers as well as aesthetic roles in the society. Considering both front and back panels of the blouse, 1 displays eight labyrinthian motifs, representing Kuna cosmology of eight upper worlds and eight underworlds, each of which is a maze traveled by shamans and the souls of the deceased. In turn, turtles (2) while certainly a foodstuff found in the seas around the San Blas islands, also symbolize the earth itself, floating like the turtle’s back in water. Central America is a thin strip of land in which both shores may be visible from high points of land, thus this turtle-like characterization of the American continent is quite true. 1.

Central America is a thin strip of land in which both shores may be visible from high points of land, thus this turtle-like characterization of the American continent is quite true. 1.

June 1991 guide term added. THE MOAB SURVEY Sherds collected on the surface and around the edges of an ancient ruin reflect its occupational history. The pottery sherds above (1) were collected at a site known today as Khirbet el-Hawiyyah. Although Khirbet el-Hawiyyah has not been excavated and its ancient name is unknown, these sherds indicate that it was occupied off and on from pre-historic times through the Ottoman period. Archaeologists are often able to recognize sherds by comparing them to broken pieces of ceramic vessels found in other excavations. The sherds above represent broken forms used during the Early Bronze Age (ca. 2900-2300 B.C.), Iron Age (ca. 1200-300 B.C.), Nabatean (ca. 300 B.C.-A.D. 100), and Late Islamic (ca. A.D. 1200-1900) periods. Archaeological surveys are conducted with close attention to the results of excavations in and near the regions surveyed. While the excavations provide ceramic control for the surveys, the surveys shed light on the general environment and the settlement patterns of the region in which the  sites are located. One of the difficulties encountered by the Emory University team in its survey of the Kerak plateau is that relatively few ruins have been excavated in southern Jordan. The map to the left locates the main excavated sites in relation to the survey area and the vessels displayed above are from three of these sites: Bab edh-Dhra' (2, 3) is located approximately 1000 meters below the Kerak plateau on the eastern edge of the Lisan peninsula. Excavated by American archaeologists beginning in 1965, it proved to be the remains of a city which flourished during the Early Bronze Age. Vessels (2, 3) displayed above are from the Bab edh-Dhra' cemetery and can be dated specifically to the Early Bronze II-III periods, approximately the time that the Great Pyramids were under construction in Egypt. The ancient name of the city is unknown (Bab edh-Dhra' is the modern Arabic name of the ruin) and there are no written records to tell us of the people who lived there. However, we know from the material remains, such as the two vessels displayed above, that they appreciated artistic beauty. Buseirah (4, 5), excavated by British archaeologists under the direction of C. M. Bennett from 1971-1974, has provided well-preserved ceramic forms from the Iron Age when this was the chief city of the Edomites. The modern Arabic name, Buseirah, preserves the ancient Edomite name, Bozrah. The Edomites and Bozrah are known from the Hebrew Bible. The two vessels from Buseirah/Bozrah displayed above (9, 10) date from Iron Age II (ca. 900-300 B.C.). El-Lejjun (6, 7), on the eastern (desert) side of the Kerak plateau, has long been identified as Betthorus, mentioned in the Notitia Dignitatum as the base camp of a Roman-Byzantine legion (legio IV Martia) during the late fourth century A.D. An American team directed by S. Thomas Parker began excavations at el-Lejjun in 1982 and, with excavations still underway, has uncovered stratified remains from the Late Roman through the Byzantine periods. The two lamps displayed above (6,7) are from Early Byzantine (4th-5th centuries A.D.) contexts, by which time the Roman Empire had divided into West and East, dominated by Rome and Byzantium (Constantinople) respectively. 1.

Permanent collection gallery: The Birth of Greek Art The earliest works in this case (12) are characteristic votive terracottas from the Neolithic culture of the fourth millennium BC, at sites in Thessaly such as Sesklo and Dhimini, and further north in the Balkans at Vinca. A far more sophisticated society flourished in the Greek islands known as the Cyclades around 3200-2200 BC. Cycladic art is today best known for its marble sculpture (2, 3, 10) and vessels (1, 5), which have been much admired for their linear elegance and sensuous forms by artists such as Pablo Picasso, Andrea Modigliani, Constantin Brancusi and Henry Moore. Contemporary with these are chalcolithic cultures in Anatolia (6). In antiquity, these so-called idols were painted; traces can still be made out on the face on the face of (2). Most are female. Their function and character is not known: it is not always clear whether the figures are standing or lying down (alive or dead?); a few female figures are pregnant. They may perhaps have been votive offerings associated with childbirth and fertility, presumably ritual. Cycladic artists also worked in clay (their vessels sharing much with marble ones), silver, bone, and shell; work in wood and in textiles, both lost, can be inferred. Architectural remains (fortifications and houses) on Naxos and Syros may not have been dissimilar from the modest houses constructed until recent times. 1. ¿Kandila. ¿  Storage jar; the string-hole handles perhaps to secure a lid.

The Objective Eye intro text: THE OBJECTIVE EYE: PHOTOGRAPHS FROM THE ROZYCKI-CROMWELL COLLECTION (September 10, 2005 through January 15, 2006) Much of photography's appeal lies in the perception that its images are a direct reflection of the world around us-a product of optics and chemistry that documents reality. What may sometimes be overlooked is that the objective eye of the camera is governed by the selective eye of the photographer. The practice of photography has always required a combination of art and science. It is significant that, at the very beginning of the medium's history, the work of David Octavius Hill and Robert Adamson was a collaboration between a painter and a technician. Throughout the nineteenth century photographers sought to define their work as a fine art analogous to painting or etching. By the 1880s photographers who aspired to be artists tried to make their photographs as much like paintings as possible, using devices like soft-focus lenses to give an impressionistic effect, retouching prints by hand, and manipulating negatives through enlargement or cropping. Early in the twentieth century photographers reacted against this Pictorialist style and insisted that photography was a fine art in its own right, without reference to any other medium. They began to probe the inherent qualities of photography and to find their subjects in contemporary life. Modernists like Paul Strand advocated ¿straight photography. ¿   This meant that final images were contact prints, the same size as the negative, using no enlargement, cropping, or any other manipulation by hand. They were factual records, not artificial creations. A new genre of photography also appeared at this time, the social documentary. Strand, following the model of his teacher Louis Hine, took his camera into streets early in his career to capture the less fortunate inhabitants of New York City. Leon Levinstein in the 1950s and Garry Winogrand in the 1960s have carried on this tradition of street photography, adding their own personal takes on the genre. It continues today with yet another twist in the work of Larry Fink. In contrast to Americans like Strand, who treated photography as high art and emphasized its integrity in its ability to accurately register facts, avant-garde photographers in Europe between the world wars were drawn to it as an experimental medium that could be adapted to a variety of uses. For the Russian Alexander Rodchenko, the camera was a revolutionary tool that made it possible to open his viewers' eyes to new ways of seeing the world. Josef Sudek, working in Czechoslovakia, followed both American and European trends in the 1920s and 1930s. He finally settled on the practice of straight photography in the 1940s and worked in this style, recording his very personal visions, until his death. Today the American Michael Smith continues working in the tradition of straight photography to capture the intricate patterns he perceives in his environment. Sarit Rozycki and Robert Cromwell, Emory class of 1982, have very generously donated a collection of over seventy photographs from which this exhibition has been drawn.

In May of that year the citizens of Edinburgh had witnessed a momentous event when a third of the clergy present at the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland had walked out in protest of the system by which appointments to churches were made. Soon after this Hill proposed to commemorate the Disruption, as it was called, in a monumental painting. An acquaintance suggested that he should take advantage of the newly invented technique of photography to make likenesses of the more than four hundred personages to be represented in the painting. Once they had photographed the founders of the Free Church of Scotland, Hill and Adamson went on to make portraits of most of the citizens of Edinburgh and their distinguished visitors. They also created what is considered to be the first social documentary series in their pictures of the inhabitants of the fishing village of Newhaven. In the course of only three years, Hill and Adamson were to make about three thousand photographs using the calotype process, the first photographic technique that, unlike the daguerreotype, used a negative, thus allowing multiple copies of an image to be made. Theirs was a synergistic partnership with Hill the artist arranging the poses and lighting of each shot, while Adamson provided the optical and chemical expertise in wielding the camera and developing the prints. Neither man on his own was able to achieve the same inventiveness and control that was evident in their collaborative work. The collaboration ended only with Adamson's premature death in January 1848.

He changed the point of observation, however, from the harsh streets of the city to the ballrooms and galleries of its privileged classes. Passing as a party photographer, Fink caught his subjects at unguarded moments in the glare of his flash. They do not pose; their humanity-and often their boredom-is disclosed in prominent relief. In 1980 Fink moved to a farm near Martin's Creek, Pennsylvania. His neighbors there were the working-class Sabatine family whose birthday parties and graduation celebrations he documented with the same paradoxically dispassionate and empathic eye that had surveyed the New York socialites.

The llama, the largest of the New World camelids (ancestors of the Old World camels), has served for millennia as the key to human survival in the rugged Andean mountains.  As pack animals, as well as sources of hair, fuel, and meat, llamas helped the Inca expand their empire into the largest in the Renaissance world.  Thus, they form a fittingly significant subject for a ritual implement.  The importance of the camelid is further underscored by the remains of a textile (most likely made from the hair of the llama\\'s cousin, the alpaca) visible on the knife\\'s right side of the blade.  Now converted into metal, a plainly woven fabric was wrapped around this special knife before its burial. In the ancient Andes, textiles protected and sanctified individuals ([headcloth 11), and obviously works of art as well (see [chancay figure 12]).

This encourages the creation of images of plump females—individuals with enough body fat to menstruate, conceive, and carry a child. This articulated figurine is four thousand years old, the oldest work in the American collection, proving that ancient does not mean artistically rudimentary. Originally they were placed with the deceased in deep shaft tombs, composed of chambers branching off a vertical opening deep below the surface. 11.

This matched pair, a man and a woman, represent a couple who were married --or the social equivalent-- in ancient West Mexico.  Other large ceramic sculptures from this region physically join individuals and smaller images often depict touching, even lovemaking.  In short, intimacy and bondedness are principal themes, implying not only the character of society but also the role of images in the grave.     West Mexican burials were placed in chambers joined to the earth\\'s surface by vertical shafts up to fifty feet in length.  The rooms of these shaft tombs were filled with many clay sculptures set at the heads of the deceased.  It appears that images of connection were deemed important to accompany the dead during the transition to the afterlife; perhaps to provide them with stand-ins for their loved ones left behind.  The extreme separation of the chambers from the surface and the fact that the long shafts were completely filled with rubble strongly suggests that the living sought to place distance between themselves and the deceased.

Pottery, jewelry, and other personal items, including alabaster jars for oil or perfume and scarab seals or amulets, were also left with the dead. Tomb P1 was one of more than one hundred tombs discovered at Jericho dating to the later Middle Bronze Age (ca. 1800-1550 bc). Typical of the period in content and shape, Tomb P1 consisted of a vertical rock-cut shaft leading into a subterranean chamber.

This memo did not discuss the X.0600-X.0697 numbered objects, as the sources and provenance of those objects had been discussed in a March 1990 memo. Information regarding the objects in the 1997 memo came from the Accession Log I (green-blue colored ledger) and old accession sheets. According to Lori\\'s memo it was unclear when the accession log was started, but was on or prior to 1984. The accession worksheets had been created in 1984. According to Lori\\'s memo, the designation of Etowah as provenance and Phillips Academy as source on the accession worksheets seemed arbitrary and not based on prior museum records. Therefore the designation of Etowah or Phillips Academy based solely on the accession worksheets may be suspect. Below is a summary of what was found for this object. X.0288-X.0351 - According to the memo, the accession log lists Phillips Academy as source; all are listed as from Etowah. I reviewed the accession log as well, and found that it listed Phillips Academy as source, but no mention of Etowah. There is no mention of an accession worksheet in the memo. There is a 1984 accession worksheet in the object file for X.0316. It notes the provenance as \"Georgia, Etowah Mounds. 1 mile down river from Jones Farm\". It also notes the \"Field Number\" as \"Box 38\". The original cigar box note for Box 38 reads \"100 flint objects, 1 broken celt, 1 rough discoid, 2 small pottery discs, 1 piece of pipe. From site one mile below Tumlin Village Site on the west bank of the Etowah River\". \"1 rough discoid\" has been crossed out. A 1984 inventory of the boxes notes Box 38 as \"Jones Farm-1 mi. downriver – possible fluted point – assorted points\". It can be presumed that X.0316 came from cigar box 38. As X.0316 was not accounted for in the 1989/1990 inventory of the cigar boxes, it is presumed that it was not returned to the box after the 1984 worksheet was created. From the 1984 worksheets and the 1989/1990 inventory, Box 38 originally contained X.0316 and X.0603.001-.005. The memos from the 1990s do not mention the \"Specimen Record\" worksheets housed in the blue fabric-covered binders. A few of these worksheets contain notes added by Lori Iliff in 1994. It is unclear why these worksheets are not mentioned in the 1990s memos, but for completeness, their information is noted here. It is however, unclear when these worksheets were created, by whom, and where the information in the worksheets came from. Many have notes regarding packing objects for storage in 1982, so it can be assumed these were created in 1982 or earlier. At this time, no Specimen Records have been located for X.0288-X.0351.

The beaded broad collar was worn around the neck, usually composed of strings of Egyptian faience (a non-clay ceramic material made of crushed quartz) beads threaded into semicircular terminals. It could also incorporate gold beads and ones made of copper or stone. Necklaces or chokers could also be worn with the broad collar along with matching sets of bracelets and anklets. At the top of the head a fillet or wreath could be worn. These often copy the form of floral ones but were made in gilded copper, faience, or other more permanent materials. Social position could also be conveyed through wooden staffs or sticks. Large wooden walking sticks are frequently shown in the hands of officials and are still carried by village elders in Upper Egyptian towns to this day. The ability to read and write was highly respected by the ancient Egyptians and a scribe’s palette was often represented to show a man’s accomplishments. Scribe’s Palette Old Kingdom, ca. 2613–2181 BC Wood 2002.33.1. Egyptian Purchase Fund This palette is made of a fine, imported hardwood.

Broad Collar Old Kingdom, ca. 2613–2181 BC From Giza, Tomb D 117 Faience Lent by the Georg Steindorff Egyptian Museum, University of Leipzig Ämul 3768 The broad collar was both worn in life and associated with the god Osiris in death. It was the most common type of ornament depicted and can be found on images of Egyptian men and women, kings and queens, and gods and goddesses from the Old Kingdom into the Roman Period. This one was made of faience beads that have faded in color. They were often also strung with gold and stone beads and would have had semicircular terminals at each end. The string from the rows of beads would have been gathered through little holes in the side of the terminal and then threaded through and tied at the back. Collar Old Kingdom, ca. 2613–2181 BC From Giza, Tomb d 117 Faience Lent by the Georg Steindorff Egyptian Museum, University of Leipzig Ämul 3763 In addition to the broad collar women and men wore a variety of other necklaces, chokers, and collars. While there are depictions of a number of different styles, few have been recovered intact. The beads were strung with thin linen thread that usually decayed, leaving a scatter of beads. Jewelry was also often pulled apart by tomb robbers looking for precious metal or semiprecious stone elements. This collar, composed of ring, tubular, and pendant faience beads with faience terminals, has been restrung in an attractive, but perhaps not authentic, way. The terminals are shown upside-down to reveal the method of stringing. Like the broad collar, it comes from the tomb of the official Uhemka. Diadem Element Old Kingdom, ca. 2613–2181 BC Faience 2011.20.1. Gift in memory of Roberta Zinni Diadems, or fillets, were worn in the hair of both men and women. They represented the wreaths of papyrus and flowers shown in the hair of men and women enjoying the marshes along the Nile. As funerary crowns they probably symbolized rebirth. A few actual examples are known and they seem to have been made out of a variety of materials, wood and copper that was gessoed and gilded, or faience, as in this example. This would have been one of the central floral elements attached to a band around the head, similar to those shown on the mummy masks of the First Intermediate Period and early Middle Kingdom.

All of the works date from the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and one from 2002. The various modes in which the artists have chosen to work encompass many of the major movements in American art in the last fifty or sixty years: abstraction, minimalism, conceptual art, and figuration. These works represent an array of visions and voices. All of the artists have challenged themselves to make new things. Their experiments have made manifest ideas and objects previously unseen. Three of the artist are native Georgians. The others were drawn to the state from the Southeast or further afield. Many first came to Atlanta to study at the Atlanta College of Art and then stayed to work and often teach. Others have studied or been instructors in the arts departments at the University of Georgia, Georgia State University, Wesleyan College, and Emory. Other institutions also provided inspiration. Of these, the Rolling Stone Press in Atlanta deserves special mention. All six of the lithographs on display were printed here under the supervision of master lithographer Wayne Kline, who founded the press in 1984. Kline, who died in 2005, was a treasure in the world of the arts in Georgia. He persuaded over sixty different artists - many who had never made a print and were dubious about the process  - to investigate the possibilities of lithography. Together they made 125 prints over a period of twenty years. This exhibition is respectfully dedicated to Dr. John Howett, professor of art history at Emory, who passed away in April of last year. Although a Renaissance scholar, he was also deeply interested in the contemporary arts in Georgia and wrote thoughtfully and penetratingly about many of the artists seen here. He was responsible for the acquisition of many of these works by the Museum. Artists in Georgia: Contemporary Works from the Collection exhibition label: Edward Ross (born Clinton, SC, 1926, died Atlanta, GA, 1976) Untitled 1976 Graphite Born in South Carolina, Ross came to Atlanta in the early 1950s to study at what became the Atlanta College of Art. He went on to teach there as well, inspiring a new generation of students. In the 1950s he began exploring abstraction, and then, in the 1960s, to experiment with the austere methods of Minimalism. His work came to focus on the idea of ¿marking¿ and ¿reading. ¿ In addition to dots or dashes of pencil or pigment, his marks might be made by scoring, punching, or tearing horizontally across the surface of the field. These marks¿the action of the artist¿were made to be read, or perceived, by the viewer of the work. In these three drawings, Ross has marked the paper repeatedly with short, delicate arcs of pencil. With repetition, the surface comes to resemble a series of waves and can be read as an undulating sea of strokes. The surfaces are sensuous, though composed with the simplest of means. In 1975, the year before these drawings were made, one of Ross¿s ¿scratch reading¿ paintings was chosen for the 1975 Whitney Biennial in New York¿one of the signs of the national attention the artist was beginning to receive when he died suddenly at the age of forty-nine.

MCCM Permanent Collection Gallery, 2013: Metalwork in Ancient Iran An enormous number of bronze objects survive from ancient Iran, bearing witness to a vigorous metalworking tradition that existed after the mid-third millennium BC. Between the second and first millennia, two regions in particular supported flourishing metalworking industries: the Gilan province of northern Iran and Luristan, a mountainous region of the central Zagros range in western Iran. Each region produced a diverse and unique repertoire of weapons, tools, horse trappings, jewelry, and objects of a personal and religious nature that displayed distinctive artistic imagery. The majority of bronze objects were either cast in the lost wax technique or hammered from sheet metal and further decorated by means of a chisel or metal punch. The small and portable nature of these objects was ideal for use by the nomadic and seminomadic herdsmen who inhabited the region along with more settled pastoralists, farmers, and horse breeders. The large numbers of objects deposited in tombs, the variety of object types, and the unique artistic imagery indicate the preoccupation these peoples had with death and the afterlife, as well as the importance of the hunt, battle, and horses. 1.

An enormous number of bronze objects survive from ancient Iran and bear witness to a vigorous metalworking tradition existing after the mid-third millennium BC. Between the second and first millennia, two regions in particular produced flourishing metalworking industries - the Gilan province of northern Iran and Luristan, a mountainous region of the central Zagros range in western Iran. Each region produced a diverse and unique repertoire of weapons, tools, horsetrappings, jewelry, and objects of a personal and religious nature which displayed a distinctive artistic imagery. The majority of bronze objects were either cast in the cire perdue (lost wax) technique or hammered from sheet metal and further decorated by use of a chisel or metal punch. The small and portable nature of these objects was ideal for use by the nomadic and semi-nomadic herdsmen who inhabited the region along with more settled pastoralists, farmers, and horsebreeders. The large numbers of objects deposited in tombs, the variety of object types, and the unique artistic imagery indicate further the preoccupation these peoples had with death and the afterlife, as well as the importance of the hunt, battle and horses. 1-4. The rich tombs in the Gilan province of northern Iran have revealed large quantities of metalwork ranging from gold and silver bowls and beakers to bronze figurines of animals and weapons. Daggers and spearheads of different shapes and sizes were extremely numerous and were left exclusively in graves belonging to men. Unlike those at Luristan, bronze weapons lacked elaborate decoration and reflects an isolate, artistic tradition. 8-15. The metalworkers of Luristan produced a wide variety of bronze objects which incorporated the stunning imagery of native animals and mythical beasts. Animal forms ranged in style from natural to abstract and were generally cast or hammered into shape as zoomorphic handles or projections on weapons and tools. 8. Since bronze required continual sharpening to maintain a useful edge, whetstones were an important piece of equipment used to hone the edges of daggers, swords, spears, arrows and axes. Whetstone handles were often cast into zoomorphic representations or animals. The ibex was the most popular choice, perhaps because of its most striking attribute - its sweeping curved horns. In almost all cases, these were curved into a convenient loop from which the whetstone was suspended. 10.  The importance of the horse in ancient Luristan is documented by the large number of surviving horse trappings and decorative harness fittings. Cheekpieces, like this example, were attached to the harness bit and were often cast in a variety of forms ranging from horses, mouflons, and boars to mythical sphinxes, griffins, and master-of-animals. Representations of figured cheekpieces appear on sculptured reliefs from Assyria, dating to the late eighth and seventh centruries BC, and indicate that these e fittings had a market outside of Luristan. 11. At the turn of the first millennium BC, metalworkers often produced bi-metallic tools and weapons with blades made of iron and decorative elements cast in bronze. This sword hilt\\'s decorative elements consist of a circular pommel decorated with two bearded human and lion head and two crouching lions which form the dagger guard. Nearly ninety iron examples of this sword type have been found and their complicated, unique, and nearly identical manufacture suggests a close association between the workshops in Luristan.12-14. Standard finials are the hallmark object of Luristan art and its bronze industry between the tenth and seventh centuries BC. These objects were mounted on bottle-shaped supports by means of a central tube or pin and are meant to be seen from both sides. Their iconography is striking, varying from rampant goats (12) and lions to the exotic master- or mistress-of-animals (13, 14) representations where abstract human-like bodies are fused with stylize lions, goats, birds, and mythical, fantastic beasts. Only a few standard finials have been recovered from excavated tombs and sanctuaries and are best interpreted as representations of local gods, deities, or demons. 1. Socketed Spearhead.

An enormous number of bronze objects survive from ancient Iran and bear witness to a vigorous metalworking tradition existing after the mid-third millennium BC. Between the second and first millennia, two regions in particular produced flourishing metalworking industries - the Gilan province of northern Iran and Luristan, a mountainous region of the central Zagros range in western Iran. Each region produced a diverse and unique repertoire of weapons, tools, horsetrappings, jewelry, and objects of a personal and religious nature which displayed a distinctive artistic imagery. The majority of bronze objects were either cast in the cire perdue (lost wax) technique or hammered from sheet metal and further decorated by use of a chisel or metal punch. The small and portable nature of these objects was ideal for use by the nomadic and semi-nomadic herdsmen who inhabited the region along with more settled pastoralists, farmers, and horsebreeders. The large numbers of objects deposited in tombs, the variety of object types, and the unique artistic imagery indicate further the preoccupation these peoples had with death and the afterlife, as well as the importance of the hunt, battle and horses. 1-4.

This memo did not discuss the X.0600-X.0697 numbered objects, as the sources and provenance of those objects had been discussed in a March 1990 memo. Information regarding the objects in the 1997 memo came from the Accession Log I (green-blue colored ledger) and old accession sheets. According to Lori\\'s memo it was unclear when the accession log was started, but it was on or prior to 1984. The accession worksheets had been created in 1984. According to Lori\\'s memo, the designation of Etowah as provenance and Phillips Academy as source on the accession worksheets seemed arbitrary and not based on prior museum records. Therefore the designation of Etowah or Phillips Academy based solely on the accession worksheets may be suspect. Below is a summary of what was found for this object. X.0288-X.0351 - According to the memo, the accession log lists Phillips Academy as source; all are listed as from Etowah. I reviewed the accession log as well, and found that it listed Phillips Academy as source, but no mention of Etowah. There is no mention of accession worksheets in the memo. There is a 1984 accession worksheet in the object file for X.0330. It notes the provenance as \"Georgia, Etowah Mounds, Tatum Farm (or Totem?) adjoining Tumlin Village site\". It also notes the \"Field Number\" as \"Box 16\". The cigar box note associated with Box 16 reads \"Arrowheads from the Totem farm adjoining Tumlin site\". As X.0330 was not accounted for in the 1989/1990 inventory of the cigar boxes, it is presumed that it was not returned to the box after the 1984 worksheet was created. From the 1984 worksheets and the 1989/1990 inventory, Box 16 originally contained X.0322, X.0330, and X.0606.001-.005.

It is however, unclear when these worksheets were created, by whom, and where the information in the worksheets came from.

According to a file memo written in March 1990 by registrar Lori Iliff, the large group of Native North American objects now numbered X.0600-. X.0697 were not registered until 1990, though they had been in the museum for decades. At the time they were stored in what were assumed to be their original boxes. In some cases, original tags were found with the objects identifying the source. In some cases there were no tags, but a tentative source was noted if other objects in the box had a source. X.0652 - X.0697 had no tags, but were found stored with other objects identified as being from W.H. Ferguson. At the time of the 1990 inventory, it was decided to note the source for these as \"Ferguson (?)\". Due to the inconclusive nature of this evidence, W.H. Ferguson does not appear as a constituent for these objects, but TMS still lists \"Gift of W.H. Ferguson(?) in the credit line field. Additionally, in the W.H. Ferguson accession file, there is an old label that reads \"Indian Artifacts Donated to Emory University Museum by Mrs. Lois Rodgers. Found in Northern Arkansas. February 22, 1966\". There is an additional handwritten note that states that during the 1990 inventory of the Native North American objects, none could be identified as having been donated by Lois Rodgers. The handwritten note states that these objects may have been combined with W.H. Ferguson\\'s objects. It is possible that some of the objects in the X.0652-X.0697 group are some of these objects. According to the 1989/1990 accession worksheet, X.0671.001-.021 were found in Box 63, Box 65, Box 66 and Box 72. According to an undated, handwritten inventory of the boxes, Box 63 contained \"1 pottery bowl, 5 large axe heads, 16 large game stones. Box 65 contained \"8 rounded game stones, 11 grinders, 1 large mortar, 1 small mortar, 5 spear heads, 6 assorted axe heads, 4 holed stones – to attach to stick, Box #1 – 221 Arrowheads (Ferguson), Box #2 – 116 Arrowheads\". Box 66 contained \"13 axe heads (assorted sizes), 1 game stone, 8 celts\".

The painted decoration on this delicate amphoriskos (1) was popular in the central Levant and featured painted net-like patterns which may imitate weaving. Another dominant style of decoration was burnished red slip (2). Piriform juglets (4) and large dipper juglets (3) are characteristic of the period.

These objects came from Buseirah or ancient Bozrah, one of the chief Edomite cities in Transjordan. At its height during the 7th century BC, the city was a major administrative center with an acropolis and palatial architecture. Due to its strategic location on one of the land routes to Egypt, the city was probably under the influence of the Assyrian empire. Weapons, like this dagger (17) were common finds of the period. 21. During the 7th century BC a system of marked and plain dome-shaped weights came into use in the Levant.

Permanent collection gallery: LEVANTINE FUNERARY MATERIAL Tombs, burial methods, and grave offerings can reveal important information about a people's origins, social order, standard of living, art, and spiritual life. The often remarkable state of preservation of furniture, mats, baskets, platters of food, boxes, and jewelry reveal that tombs were literally houses for the dead, stocked with personal possessions and all the provisions necessary in an afterlife. The diverse objects deposited in tombs often provide our only record of how people lived. They also offer clues to the origins of different populations.

The site remained sparsely settled until the end of the fourth millennium when new settlers arrived and established a culture which formed the basis for the first urbanized center that developed later on the site. Out of these Proto-Urban origins, Jericho's Early Bronze Age culture emerged, drawing from local and new traditions filtering through the Levant from Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia. Jericho developed from an unsophisticated, agricultural village to an independent, urbanized town whose inhabitants built and maintained public works that included an extensive defensive wall, public buildings with brick pavement, and silos for the storage of grain. The population of Jericho managed a successful economy largely based on the cultivation of cereals (wheat, barley), legumes (peas, lentils, chickpeas), and other plants, including dates, flax, and onions. Surviving artifacts reveal that trade existed with faraway regions and that specialized craftsmen, including metal workers, potters, and artisans of minor crafts also contributed to the economy. Graves and burial offering provide most of our information about Jericho during the period. Several generations of extended families or members of certain social groups used the same graves over long periods of time. Burial chambers were hewn out of the stone faces of riverbeds, northeast of the city mound, and were generally used for multiple burials. Pottery, jewelry and weapons were the most common goods deposited with the dead. Jericho's Early Bronze Age town flourished until the second half of the third millennium B.C. Along with other towns and cities in the Levant, Jericho was destroyed and temporarily abandoned. The disruptions of the time may have been the result of drought, erosion, and deforestation as well as internal conflicts among the Levantine towns and cities. Raids by semi-nomadic peoples, Egyptians, or perhaps the arrival of western Semitic¿ Amorites¿ from Syria also may have contributed to the regional turmoil and demise of Jericho. 1-4. Pottery, with its different shapes and decoration, is our primary source for understanding the cultural origins, foreign influences, and international connections for the people of Jericho. These vessels represent one of the three pottery traditions at the site during the Proto-Urban period. Called Proto-Urban A, this tradition consisted of handmade bowls and jugs that were covered with a burnished or polished red slip. Parallels with similar pottery traditions in the Near East suggest the influence of people from Syria and Anatolia. 5-8. Jewelry was a common offering in graves of men and women during the Proto-Urban period. Beads made of shell, turquoise, carnelian, and other materials not obtainable locally indicate that Jericho's population engaged in trade with other regions including the Eastern Mediterranean, the Sinai, and Anatolia. 9. Although the period is called Early Bronze Age, bronze (an alloy of copper and tin) was virtually non-existent at Jericho. Copper was sometimes used for certain tools and weapons including daggers or axeheads, but these objects were rarely deposited in tombs. When the copper or bronze objects do appear in tombs, they are usually in the form of highly prized jewelry, rings, bracelets and beads. 10-12. Animal bones with holes partially drilled into one end were deposited as offerings in some of the Early Bronze Age graves. Though called by various names, including ¿idols¿, ¿dolls¿, or ¿cult objects¿, their function remains a mystery. 13-24. Pottery from the Early Bronze Age was essentially handmade, though parts of vessels were made on a simple potter's wheel. Vessels were usually covered with a burnished red slip. Shapes of the period included storage jars, cooking pots, deep kraters (mixing vessels for wine), jugs, juglets (16-22) and amphoriskoi (perfume or oil bottles). Little juglets and amphoriskoi were used to store precious oils and small flat bowls (23) served as oil lamps. 1,2. Bowls. Tomb K1. Proto-Urban, 3300-3050 BC. Clay. 1955.111, 89. 3.

A number of otherwise poor burials of the period had mummies bedecked with ensembles of beautiful jewels. The Intermediate Period saw many innovations, including the appearance of scarabs, many of which were carved with pseudo-hieroglyphic inscriptions by illiterate artists. With the return to general prosperity in the Middle Kingdom, lavish jewelry and cosmetics were provided for the living and the dead. Semiprecious stones and exotic materials were crafted into necklaces, pendants, and cosmetic equipment. Strands of uniform beads were worn in sets of alternating color and material.

Of particular significance was the \"sweret\" bead, a barrel shaped bead, usually made of carnelian and worn on a string around the neck, which was believed to protect the throat. The beaded broad collar with the falcon terminals was specified as part of the funerary equipment needed by the deceased in the coffin texts. The association with the god Horus undoubtedly gave this piece of jewelry magical healing quality. Scarabs also became frequent objects of adornment in this period and are worn either as rings with simple string or wire shanks, or as part of necklaces.

Invention and Revival into text: INVENTION AND REVIVAL: NORTHERN EUROPEAN PRINTS Prints are meant to be propagated. Artists carve wooden blocks or incise metal plates in order to make multiple impressions on paper of their designs, their inventions. Printmaking is a field rich with possibilities for experimentation. Artists are challenged to test the limits of the medium, to discover just how much can be expressed by making marks on wood or metal. Once it leaves the workshop a print can travel far to win fame for the printmaker and to serve as a model for other artists. Thus, experiments and inventions become a part of the history of printmaking, forming a tradition that succeeding printmakers will react to, revive, and reinvent. There are two basic forms of print processes-relief and intaglio. The woodcut is a relief process in which material is carved away from the lines of the design. Engravings, etchings, and drypoints are all intaglio processes in which lines are cut into a copper plate from which impressions will be made. In engraving a tool called a burin is used to gouge grooves directly into the plate. Etching allows an artist to draw more freely, scratching with a needle through a ground of resin, gum, or wax that has been applied to the plate. Once the design is complete the plate is bathed in acid which bites into the metal where the surface coating has been scraped away by the needle. In drypoint the artist works directly on the plate with a very hard needle that throws up a rough burr of metal on either side of the drawn line. Both woodcuts and engravings first appeared in Europe in Germany in the fifteenth century. Having mastered woodcut and engraving, Albrecht Dürer also tried his hand at etching and drypoint, but did not systematically pursue his efforts. Lucas van Leyden was the first artist to make etchings on copper plates and combined this process with engraving. Later in the seventeenth century etching became the preferred technique of artists, and Rembrandt regularly combined it with drypoint to add strong, dark accents to his prints.

Handbook Entry: \"Born in Haarlem, Galle was an engraver, printmaker, and art dealer. He probably trained with Dirck Volkertsz. Coornhert, but eventually he moved to Antwerp, and it was there that he associated with the chief artistic and scientific figures of Flemish Humanism, notably the circle of Hieronymus Cock, Hubert Goltzius, and Christophe Plantin. Cock was one of the most entrepreneurial figures of his day. His \"\"Four Winds\"\" publishing house employed dozens of artists and was responsible for the production of no less than eleven hundred prints in the space of a decade. Cock was the employer of such noted artists Peter Brueghel, George Ghisi, and Cornelius Cort, and most of Galle\\'s prints were produced under Cock\\'s auspices.   Galle\\'s manner as an engraver tends to adapt to that of the artist he copies. This rare engraving is one of the most spectacular examples of Galle\\'s command of the male nude. As discussed by Vasari, Michelangelo had effectively established the primacy of the male nude in the vocabulary of figure painting, and in the wake of Michelangelo\\'s achievement most artists turned to the nude as demonstrations of their technical and narrative powers. This is the context in which to understand Galle\\'s engraving. It was executed after a drawing by Luca Penni, a student of Raphael who himself specialized in prints, drawings for prints, and tapestry designs. Although Penni\\'s manner was Roman, he was an early and crucial member of the School of Fontainebleau, whose collective accomplishment played so a decisive role in the dissemination to the North of Florentine style. Penni himself was widely copied by Flemish engravers. The original drawing for Galle\\'s engraving survives in the collections of the Louvre.     \" Handbook Entry: \"Born in Haarlem, Galle was an engraver, printmaker, and art dealer.

Maya Polychrome Ceramics During their height between 600 and 900 AD, the Maya created bowls (1, 2), tall beakers (3–5) and effigy flutes (6) painted with buff, orange, and black slip. The subjects may be expressively human, such as a gentle and genteel Maya mother with a child on her back (6, the baby’s head has broken off). They may relate to rulers, adding a profile face found on royal headdresses and scepters (5) to a container for drinking the high-status chocolate beverage kakaw. Further up the scale, some vessels concern deities: 2 represents the snakefooted god K’awil, patron of divination and rulership. Highly esoteric images include disembodied eyeballs interspersed with jaguar spots (4), perhaps a reference to the addition of entheogens to the kakaw and the dizzying visions of becoming a jaguar that result.

Maya ceramics are most commonly polychrome, but earlier ones may be blackwares (9, 10) and, later, unslipped buffwares (8, 11, 12). Green stones were of the highest value to the Maya, and elite men were almost literally dripping with them: belt celts dangled from their waists (2), earspools from their ears (4, 7), and pendants from their necks (5). Blue, a rare color in jadeite, was especially desired, but the sparkling qualities of other minerals were favored as well. 4.  Pair of Circular Earspools. Omphacite.

Permanent collection galleries 130B: THE LEVANT Pottery in Levantine Archaeology pottery plays an essential role in understanding ancient cultures, for it often reflects the various influences present in a region at a given time. In the Levant, pottery illustrates the region\\'s important role as a bridge between Egypt, Syria, Mesopotamia, and other areas of the Near East. One example of this cross-cultural influence is commonly known as Tell el-Yehudia ware, after a site in the Egyptian Delta. This vessel type evolved from small piriform, or pear-shaped juglets that originated in the Levant and were copied in Egypt in a black polished version incised with patterns of white-filled dots or lines. Some vessels of this type also show Aegean decorative motifs, such as the running spiral or Near Eastern motifs of men mastering animals. Other distinctive styles of Levantine pottery help archaeologists date sites and add to the historical record of the area recounted in the Bible and contemporary texts. In addition, the transferral of pottery shapes and decorative motifs to other media, such as the wood and stone objects here, also can be of use in dating and interpreting the cultural remains at a site. 1.

The Levant: Bronze-Iron Ages (ca. 3300-586 BC) The material culture of the Levant illustrates the region\\'s important role as a bridge between Egypt, Syria, Mesopotamia, and other areas of the Near East. Direct and indirect contacts with these cultures influences much of the history and cultural development of the Levant. The objects reflect this development from the strong, local traditions of the Early Bronze Age to Egyptian and eastern Mediterranean influences of the later Bronze Age. During the Iron Age, the diversity of objects and artistic styles demonstrates further the arrival and emergence of many regional ethnic cultures ranging from the Canaanites, Philistines, Phoenicians and Israelitees in Syria and Palestine to the Edomites, Moabites, Ammonitees and Arameans in Transjordan. 1-2. During the Early Bronze Age, many of the pottery shapes and decoration in the Levant were locally inspired. The painted decoration on this delicate amphoriskos (1) was popular in the central Levant and featured painted net-like patterns which may imitate weaving. Another dominant style of decoration was burnished red slip (2). This surface technique occurred on many of the vessels left as grave offerings at the cemetery of Babe dh Dhra, and Early Bronze Age site east of the Dead Sea in Transjordan. 304. During the Middle Bronze Age, the innovation of a fast potter\\'s wheel resulted in a variety of new and elegant vessel shapes. Piriform juglets (4) and large dipper juglets (3) are characteristic of the period. 5-6. The Late Bronze Age was marked by a profusion of imported pottery from the eastern Mediterranean. ¿Bilbil¿ jugs (5) with their unique shape, were one of the predominant imported wares from Cyrus and the most popular form imitated by Levantine potters. Many of the Cypriot imports, including bilbils and flasks (6) were painted with a distinctive brown-on-white decoration, called base ring ware  Imported pottery seems to have satisfied local tastes for fine tableware during the period, perhaps because the quality of Levantine pottery was in decline. 8-9 One of the most persistent and popular vessel forms was the pilgrim flask, which first appeared during the Late Bronze Age. Its form was produced by joining two wheel-thrown bowls and adding a wheel-made neck and handles. These flasks normally stored water and were carried by straps wrapped around the handles. 10-11. Imports and imitations of pottery traditions from the eastern Mediterranean continued well into the Iron Age. Called black-on-red ware, this juglet (10) is distinguished by its burnished red slip with black geometric decoration and was imported from Cypris. Another popular shape was the pyxis (11) whose form was almost certainly of Mycenaean origin. Like so many other imported vessels, the shape was adopted and underwent alterations in shape, design and decoration under the influence of local pottery trends in the Levant. 18.  This ¿Ashdoda¿ figurine fragment is from Jerusalem and demonstrates Philistine culture in the Levant during the Iron Age. The four-legged seat, displayed here, originally was attached to a flat, vertical back, shaped in the form of a female figure with a long neck, large pinched nose, and appliquéd eyes. Used as cult objects, these figurines were a schematic representation of a female deity and throne and reflect a Mycenaean religious heritage that was preserved by the Philistines. 14-15. These objects came from Buseirah or ancient Bozrah, one of the chief Edomite cities in Transjordan. At its height during the 7th century BC, the city was a major administrative center with an acropolis and palatial architecture. Due to its strategic location on one of the land routes to Egypt, the city was probably under the influence of the Assyrian empire. Weapons, like this dagger (17) were common finds of the period. A large proportion of the pottery (17) was simply painted in a fashion local to the region and northern Arabia. 21. During the 7th century BC a system of marked and plain dome-shaped weights came into use in the Levant. The different sized weights were based on the shekel, averaging 11.4 grams, and were used for weighing payment in the form of silver ingots for trade transactions. 1. Amphoriskos. Levant.

This is known from notes (written on Phillips Academy letterhead) which were attached to the original cigar boxes where the Etowah material was stored.

NOTE: UPDATED 08/26/2021 with information from 1990 accession worksheet. According to a file memo written in March 1990 by registrar Lori Iliff, the large group of Native North American objects now numbered X.0600-. X.0697 were not registered until 1990, though they had been in the museum for decades. At the time they were stored in what were assumed to be their original boxes. In some cases, original tags were found with the objects identifying the source. In some cases there were no tags, but a tentative source was noted if other objects in the box had a source. X.0652 - X.0697 had no tags, but were found stored with other objects identified as being from W.H. Ferguson. At the time of the 1990 inventory, it was decided to note the source for these as \"Ferguson (?)\". Due to the inconclusive nature of this evidence, W.H. Ferguson does not appear as a constituent for these objects, but TMS still lists \"Gift of W.H. Ferguson(?) in the credit line field. Additionally, in the W.H. Ferguson accession file, there is an old label that reads \"Indian Artifacts Donated to Emory University Museum by Mrs. Lois Rodgers. Found in Northern Arkansas. February 22, 1966\". There is an additional handwritten note that states that during the 1990 inventory of the Native North American objects, none could be identified as having been donated by Lois Rodgers. The handwritten note states that these objects may have been combined with W.H. Ferguson\\'s objects. It is possible that some of the objects in the X.0652-X.0697 group are some of these objects.

Radical artistic and religious changes mark the reign of his son and successor, the ¿heretic¿ pharaoh Akhenaten (1353-1336 BC) and his queen, Nefertiti, who established a new capital at the site of Tell el-Amarna. During the Amarna Period, the cult of the royal family grew, in part to replace the other deities that had been proscribed. The king was now the intermediary between the sun god, Aten, and the worshipping Egyptians. Even images of the royal children could embody such concepts as fertility and rebirth. Following this turbulent period, Tutankhamun (1332-1322 BC) and his successors, Ay and Horemheb, returned the court to Thebes and reinstated the worship of the traditional pantheon. 1.

Monsters & Demons label: Horse-men: Satyrs Dionysos, the god of wine, is often portrayed with a retinue of followers (thiasos) (1). The females in the archaic period were nymphs¿semi-divine woodland spirits. During the classical period, they change identity and become mortal maenads. The male  followers, the older silenoi or younger satyrs, were partly equine. As with their close relatives, the centaurs, the equine elements can vary: satyrs invariably have horses¿ ears; most have tails; and some have hooves. They are often thought of as shaggy (2, 3), and their bulging eyes and heavy beards contribute to a sense of bestiality rather than humanity. Interested primarily in wine, women, and song, their antics offer a countermodel to humanity rather than a caricature of bad male behavior. Just occasionally we glimpse their own domestic backgrounds: a jug shows a maenad bringing up a baby satyr. Still more rarely, the maenads have the upper hand, even pulling one satyr by the tail (4). Although centaurs first appear in the ancient Near East, as shown earlier in this exhibition, the origin of the satyr, however, is less clear. It has been proposed that they may be related to Hebrew sirim, sub-human, hairy demons, Isaiah¿s ¿wild beasts of the desert. ¿ The story of Silenos, however, is set in Phrygia, and indeed another story concerning Midas related how his ears were turned into those of a donkey by Apollo: the god was angry that Midas did not endorse the adjudication of his victory in a musical contest with Pan (6). 1.

Votive Statuette of Pan Roman, 2nd century AD. Bronze. Gift of Michael J. Shubin. 2008.31.479 Monsters & Demons label: Horse-men: Satyrs Dionysos, the god of wine, is often portrayed with a retinue of followers (thiasos) (1). The females in the archaic period were nymphs¿semi-divine woodland spirits. During the classical period, they change identity and become mortal maenads. The male  followers, the older silenoi or younger satyrs, were partly equine. As with their close relatives, the centaurs, the equine elements can vary: satyrs invariably have horses¿ ears; most have tails; and some have hooves. They are often thought of as shaggy (2, 3), and their bulging eyes and heavy beards contribute to a sense of bestiality rather than humanity. Interested primarily in wine, women, and song, their antics offer a countermodel to humanity rather than a caricature of bad male behavior. Just occasionally we glimpse their own domestic backgrounds: a jug shows a maenad bringing up a baby satyr. Still more rarely, the maenads have the upper hand, even pulling one satyr by the tail (4). Although centaurs first appear in the ancient Near East, as shown earlier in this exhibition, the origin of the satyr, however, is less clear. It has been proposed that they may be related to Hebrew sirim, sub-human, hairy demons, Isaiah¿s ¿wild beasts of the desert. ¿ The story of Silenos, however, is set in Phrygia, and indeed another story concerning Midas related how his ears were turned into those of a donkey by Apollo: the god was angry that Midas did not endorse the adjudication of his victory in a musical contest with Pan (6). 1.

MCCM Permanent Collection Gallery, 2013: Art in Ancient Mesopotamia Compared to its neighbors Egypt and Iran, Mesopotamia had few natural resources for artists. Stone and metal had to be imported and were costly. Likewise, there was no good domestic source of ivory or timber, so simple clay was an important medium for artistic expression. In the prehistoric periods, pottery vessels were decorated in paint with geometric patterns in black and red, but by the end of the third millennium BC, these motifs were abandoned and, with the exception of incised designs, the pots were left undecorated. Ceramic sculpture, however, could be painted, and in eras when stone was scarce, very fine craftsmen turned out beautifully carved and painted figures and inlays of clay or in faience. Much of what we know of the art of this region comes from seals. In the third millennium BC, stamp seals evolved to mark personal possessions and later developed into the cylinder seal that would be rolled across mud stoppers on jars, tablets, clay seals on documents, commodities, and even doors. 1.

This illustration to the Ramayana is an intimate miniature painted scene from the Indian epic of the Ramayana. As a result of palace intrigue, Rama has been banished from his rightful throne for 14 years. In solidarity and service, his wife Sita and brother Lakshmana have followed him into exile. In this scene, Lakshmana tenderly removes a thorn from his brother Rama's foot as the latter steadies himself, his hand upon Hanuman's shoulder. This brotherly act of compassion takes place in a calm forest setting with a golden-hued sky as backdrop.

Much like the historic colonial explorers of new spaces and cultures, I find myself moving through the storage facilities of museums discovering references to cultures from my home country, South Africa, the African continent and other contexts scattered around the world that have been brought to the world museum collections. To me the objects take on new meanings, prepped and poised for presentation and study, they become new forms where conservation and packaging materials start to create new works, giving the objects a new life and meaning if seen out of context. My documentation by filming the collection with a torch and capturing the new shadow forms, becomes as much about the reflection on the mystery and curiosity as it is about my own uncertainty of never really understanding the complexity of why the objects are in these museums in the first place. The resulting works in the case of the Carlos Museum is a video of discovery shown publicly on the outside of the museum during my residency in March 2015, a series of outline drawings of the new shaped during my journey of discovery and 3 packaging crates form the storage facility that have outline drawings of new object types form the film on all sides. Part of the intention of the work is to allow the packaging crates used for moving the objects to be included in the collection. Per 12/21/2015 email from Marcus Neustetter, the components can be selected and assembled as needed. Peeling labels should be kept on the crates in their current state. 12/18/2015 email from Marcus Neustetter stated that the drawings have no particular orientation or order of hanging - that is a curatorial choice. The crates can be stacked or seen separately,  As of 12/18/2015, we are still waiting on clarification on whether all 3 crates and 72 drawings need to be installed together, or if a subset of components is acceptable. Also still waiting on clarification on the condition of peeling labels on crates. In conjunction with the African Cosmos: Stellar Arts exhibition, Marcus Neustetter was Artist-in-Residence at the MCCM from 03/16/2015-03/22/2015. During his time at the MCCM, he created an artwork as a gift to the museum. The artwork was composed of 3 crates that Marcus Neustetter painted and 72 drawings on notecards. The crate were from the MCCM off-site storage area and had previously been designated \"to be recyled\". Curator Amanda Hellman is following up with Marcis Neustetter to clarify several questions: Is the arrangement of the work is the curator\\'s perogative? Can the elements can be displayed independently or must the all be displayed simulaneously?

Also in the Accession Lot is a 2003 email from Dick Keresey of Sotheby\\'s to David Harris advising him of people to contact who may wish to sell the collection. Based on our past experience with Baidun (see Israeli Toilet Box at offsite storage and his fabulous quote of \"Oh, it break? I send more.), I suspect David Harris was not a collector of antiquities. He was involved with some kind of business deal with Baidun. How they knew each other is anyone\\'s guess.
